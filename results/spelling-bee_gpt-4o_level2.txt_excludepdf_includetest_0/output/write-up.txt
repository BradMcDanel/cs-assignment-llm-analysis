# Spelling Bee Project Write-up

## Overview
The Spelling Bee project is designed to implement a game where users find words using a set of given letters in a beehive pattern. The project emphasizes string processing, file handling, and interactivity through a graphical interface.

## Milestones

### Milestone #1: Initialize the Beehive
- Implemented the `puzzle_action` function to validate and set puzzle letters. 
- The function checks for a 7-letter input, uniqueness, and alphabetic characters.

### Milestone #2: Display Legal Words
- Implemented the `solve_action` function to find valid words from a dictionary.
- The function checks word length, letter validity, and presence of the center letter.

### Milestone #3: Add Scores
- Extended `solve_action` to calculate and display word scores.
- Implemented additional bonus for pangrams and displayed them in a different color.

### Milestone #4: User Interaction
- Added a "Word" field for user input.
- Implemented validation checks for user input and provided feedback through messages.

## Challenges
- Handling case sensitivity and ensuring the correct conversion between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Refactoring code to ensure modularity and reusability of functions.

## Possible Extensions
- Implement a shuffle feature for the outer letters.
- Generate new puzzle configurations programmatically.
- Explore interesting puzzles with unique characteristics like high scores or rare words.
