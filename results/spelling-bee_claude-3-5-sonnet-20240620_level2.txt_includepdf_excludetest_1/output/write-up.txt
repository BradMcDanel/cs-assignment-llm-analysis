This implementation of the SpellingBee game fulfills all the requirements specified in the assignment:

1. It uses the provided SpellingBeeGraphics class for the GUI.
2. It implements the puzzle_action function to set up the beehive with valid 7-letter puzzles.
3. It implements the solve_action function to find and display all valid words for a given puzzle.
4. It calculates and displays scores for each word and the total score.
5. It implements the word_action function to allow users to enter words and play the game interactively.

The code is structured into several helper functions to improve readability and maintainability:

- load_dictionary(): Loads the word list from the file.
- is_valid_puzzle(): Checks if a given puzzle string is valid.
- is_valid_word(): Checks if a word is valid for the current puzzle.
- calculate_score(): Calculates the score for a given word.

The main spelling_bee() function sets up the GUI and initializes global variables. The puzzle_action(), solve_action(), and word_action() functions handle the core game logic.

This implementation covers all four milestones mentioned in the assignment:
1. Initializing the beehive with letters from the puzzle field.
2. Displaying legal words in the SpellingBee puzzle.
3. Adding scores to the display.
4. Letting the user try to find words.

The code also handles error cases and provides appropriate feedback to the user through the message display.
