In this assignment, I learned about the implementation of the Enigma machine using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
I implemented the model component that simulates the internal state and operations of the Enigma machine, including
key presses, lamp lighting, and rotor advancement and encryption. I also understood how to handle permutations and
rotor offsets to achieve the desired encryption behavior. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of how
historical cryptographic devices functioned and how to simulate them in a modern programming environment.
