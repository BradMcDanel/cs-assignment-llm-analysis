This implementation follows the assignment requirements:

1. It reads the food web filename from command line arguments or prompts the user if not provided.

2. It loads the food web data into a dictionary with predators as keys and lists of prey as values.

3. It implements separate functions for each part of the analysis:
   - print_predators_and_prey()
   - find_apex_predators()
   - find_producers()
   - find_most_flexible_eaters()
   - find_tastiest()
   - calculate_heights()

4. It uses the provided format_list() function for formatting the predator-prey relationships.

5. It performs error checking when opening the file.

6. It follows good programming practices like using descriptive variable names, avoiding global variables, and including comments.

7. The main logic is contained within functions, with only the main() function call outside.

8. It doesn't use break or continue statements.

The program should correctly analyze food webs and produce the required output for all parts of the assignment.
