In this assignment, I implemented a Python program that identifies the owner of a DNA sequence by comparing it with a CSV file containing STR counts of individuals. The program reads the DNA sequence and CSV file, computes the longest consecutive runs of STRs in the DNA sequence, and matches it with the individuals in the CSV file to determine the likely owner of the DNA sequence. The program provides a real-world application of algorithmic thinking and string manipulation in the context of DNA profiling.
