In this assignment, I learned how to process and analyze data from a CSV file to determine various relationships in a food web. By leveraging Python's data structures, such as dictionaries and lists, I was able to store and manipulate data efficiently. Implementing functions to calculate apex predators, producers, and other characteristics helped solidify my understanding of algorithm design and data analysis. Additionally, I practiced error handling and ensuring robust user interaction through command line arguments.
