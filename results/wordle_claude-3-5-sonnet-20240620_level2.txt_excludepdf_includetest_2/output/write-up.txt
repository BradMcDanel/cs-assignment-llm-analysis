This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The hidden word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS and converted to uppercase.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function first checks if the entered word is in the word list.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list" message.

3. Color the boxes:
   - The code iterates through each letter of the guess, comparing it to the hidden word.
   - It colors boxes green for correct positions, yellow for correct letters in wrong positions, and gray for incorrect letters.
   - The coloring logic handles cases with multiple occurrences of letters correctly.

4. Color the keys:
   - As boxes are colored, the corresponding keys on the virtual keyboard are also updated.
   - The key colors are set to match the most "positive" result (green > yellow > gray).

Additional features:
- The game ends when the correct word is guessed or after 6 attempts.
- A congratulatory message is shown on correct guess.
- The hidden word is revealed if not guessed after 6 attempts.

This implementation provides a fully functional Wordle game that meets all the requirements specified in the assignment.
