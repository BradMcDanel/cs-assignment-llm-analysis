# Implementation Overview:
This implementation of Wordle follows a structured approach by breaking down the task into milestones. We start by selecting a random word and displaying it, then move on to checking the validity of user-entered words, coloring the boxes based on guess correctness, and finally updating the keyboard colors.

# Challenges and Considerations:
1. **Coloring Logic:** Properly handling letter coloring, especially with repeated letters, requires careful tracking of used letters.
2. **Case Sensitivity:** Ensuring consistent letter casing between user input and dictionary lookup.
3. **User Feedback:** Providing clear messages for valid guesses and incorrect attempts enhances user experience.

# Extensions:
1. Implement a separate dictionary for selected hidden words to balance letter frequency.
2. Enhance victory animation by cycling colors.
3. Track user statistics across games in a persistent manner.
