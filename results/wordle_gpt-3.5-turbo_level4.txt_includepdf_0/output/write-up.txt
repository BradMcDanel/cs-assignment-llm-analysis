In this assignment, I will implement the Wordle game by gradually completing the required milestones. I will start by picking a random word and displaying it in the first row of boxes. Next, I will check whether the letters entered by the user form a valid word. Then, I will add functionality to color the boxes based on the correctness of the guessed word. Finally, I will implement coloring the keys on the virtual keyboard. Each milestone will be completed step by step to ensure a functional Wordle game.
