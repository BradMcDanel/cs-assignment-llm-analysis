2. date - The date on which the shooting occurred. Examples: 2015-01-02, 2015-01-03.
3. threat_type - The type of threat perceived by the police. Examples: point, move.
...
14. state - The U.S. state where the incident occurred. Examples: WA, OR, KS.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following information: name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state from the dataset.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys used in the database are the unique 'id' values from the dataset.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

Question 4:

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to process and analyze real-world datasets using Python. I became familiar with using dictionaries to organize and retrieve data efficiently. Analyzing the dataset revealed disparities in fatal police shootings, particularly with respect to race, highlighting social issues that require attention. This project emphasized the importance of data science in understanding and addressing societal problems. Overall, the process enhanced my programming and analytical skills.
