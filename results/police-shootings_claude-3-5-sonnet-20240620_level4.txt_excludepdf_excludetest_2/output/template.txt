Task 1:
Question 1:
The data includes information on fatal police shootings in the United States since January 1, 2015. It is compiled by The Washington Post and updated regularly. The dataset contains details such as the date of the incident, victim's name, age, gender, race, location, and circumstances of the shooting.

Question 2:
1. id: Unique identifier for each incident. Examples: 22, 325, 140
2. name: Name of the deceased. Examples: "John Doe", "Jane Smith"
3. date: Date of the incident. Examples: "2015-01-02", "2016-07-15"
4. manner_of_death: How the person died. Examples: "shot", "shot and Tasered"
5. armed: Whether and how the person was armed. Examples: "gun", "knife", "unarmed"
6. age: Age of the deceased. Examples: 25, 40, 18
7. gender: Gender of the deceased. Examples: "M", "F"
8. race: Race of the deceased. Examples: "W" (White), "B" (Black), "H" (Hispanic)
9. city: City where the incident occurred. Examples: "Los Angeles", "New York"
10. state: State where the incident occurred. Examples: "CA", "NY", "TX"
11. signs_of_mental_illness: Presence of mental illness signs. Examples: "True", "False"
12. threat_level: Perceived threat level. Examples: "attack", "other", "undetermined"
13. flee: Whether the person was fleeing. Examples: "Not fleeing", "Car", "Foot"
14. body_camera: Presence of body camera footage. Examples: "True", "False"

Question 3:
According to the 2020 United States Census, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.

Task 2:
Question 1: The information stored in database includes id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera.

Question 2: The 'id' column from the CSV file is used as the keys in database.

Question 3: The type of the values in database is dict (dictionary).

Question 4: Each value in database stores a dictionary containing information about a single fatal police shooting incident. For example:
{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'date': '2015-01-02',
    'manner_of_death': 'shot',
    'armed': 'gun',
    'age': '36',
    'gender': 'M',
    'race': 'W',
    'city': 'Los Angeles',
    'state': 'CA',
    'signs_of_mental_illness': 'False',
    'threat_level': 'attack',
    'flee': 'Not fleeing',
    'body_camera': 'False'
}

Task 3:
Question 1: The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (as calculated by the code) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black people are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is even higher than the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black people are even more disproportionately represented among unarmed subjects of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population and in all fatal police shootings.

Task 4:
Reflection:
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with real-world data using Python. I learned how to read and process data from a CSV file, organize it into a dictionary structure, and perform various analyses on the data. The project highlighted the power of using dictionaries for data analysis and the importance of careful data manipulation.

The results of the analysis were eye-opening and concerning. They revealed a significant disparity in the representation of black individuals in fatal police shootings, especially in cases where the subject was unarmed. This project emphasized the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues.

I also learned about the challenges of working with real-world data, such as dealing with missing or inconsistent information. The project improved my skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and interpretation. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of writing clear, well-commented code and organizing complex analyses into manageable steps.

Overall, this project not only enhanced my Python programming skills but also deepened my understanding of how data analysis can shed light on critical societal issues. It demonstrated the power of programming as a tool for social research and the responsibility that comes with interpreting such sensitive data.
