I have implemented the Wordle game according to the provided instructions. The game allows users to guess a hidden five-letter word and provides feedback on the correctness of their guesses. The code is structured into separate modules for dictionary management, graphics handling, and game logic. Unit tests have been written to ensure the functionality of the game under different scenarios.
