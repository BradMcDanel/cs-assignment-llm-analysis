This implementation fulfills the requirements of the assignment:

1. It reads the food web filename from a command line argument or prompts the user if not provided.
2. It performs error checking for file existence and number of command line arguments.
3. The predator-prey relationships are stored in a dictionary as required.
4. The file is only read once.
5. Files are properly closed using a with statement.
6. The code is divided into appropriate functions for each part of the analysis.
7. There are no global variables used (except for imports and the main function call).
8. The code uses good programming style with appropriate variable names, comments, and function descriptions.
9. break and continue are not used in the implementation.

The main function orchestrates the overall flow of the program, calling each analysis function in turn and printing the results. Each part of the analysis (apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and heights) is implemented in a separate function for modularity and readability.

The heights calculation uses the iterative algorithm provided in the assignment description rather than a recursive approach.

The format_list function from the provided module is used for consistent output formatting.

This implementation should correctly analyze the food web data and produce the required output for all parts of the assignment.
