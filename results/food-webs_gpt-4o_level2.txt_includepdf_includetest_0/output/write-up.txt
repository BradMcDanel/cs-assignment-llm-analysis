## Approach
1. **Reading the Input File**: The program reads the food web data from a CSV file provided either as a command-line argument or through user input. The data is stored in a dictionary where the keys are predators and the values are lists of their respective prey.

2. **Displaying Predators and Prey**: The program formats and displays the predator-prey relationships using the `format_list` function to ensure proper formatting.

3. **Identifying Apex Predators**: Apex predators are identified as those that do not appear in any prey list.

4. **Identifying Producers**: Producers are those organisms that do not act as predators in the food web.

5. **Finding the Most Flexible Eaters**: The most flexible eaters are identified as predators with the highest number of prey.

6. **Finding the Tastiest Organisms**: Tastiest organisms are those that are preyed upon by the most number of different predators.

7. **Calculating Heights**: The program calculates the height of each organism in the food web based on the longest path to a producer.

8. **Modular Design**: The solution is divided into multiple functions for each part of the assignment to ensure modularity and readability.

## Challenges
- **Formatting the Output**: Ensuring proper formatting for the predator-prey relationships required careful handling of commas and conjunctions.
- **Calculating Heights**: Determining the height of each organism involved understanding and implementing a recursive-like algorithm iteratively.

## Conclusion
This assignment provided a comprehensive exercise in file handling, data processing, and algorithm design in Python. It emphasized the importance of modular programming and proper formatting in generating readable and maintainable code.
