Implementation Explanation:

1. Dictionary Loading:
   - The dictionary is loaded from the file and stored as a set for efficient lookup.

2. Puzzle Validation:
   - The is_valid_puzzle function checks if the input consists of 7 unique letters.

3. Word Validation:
   - is_valid_word ensures words are at least 4 letters long, contain the center letter, and use only puzzle letters.

4. Scoring:
   - calculate_score implements the scoring system, including the pangram bonus.

5. Puzzle Action:
   - Validates and sets the puzzle letters in the beehive.

6. Solve Action:
   - Finds all valid words, calculates scores, and displays them with color coding for pangrams.

7. Word Action:
   - Handles user word input, validates it, and updates the score and word list.

8. User Interface:
   - Uses SpellingBeeGraphics for display and interaction.

This implementation covers all four milestones:
- Initializing the beehive with validated puzzle letters
- Displaying legal words with scores
- Adding scores to the display
- Allowing user input to find words

The code is structured to be modular and readable, with separate functions for each main functionality. It uses the provided SpellingBeeGraphics class for all UI interactions.
