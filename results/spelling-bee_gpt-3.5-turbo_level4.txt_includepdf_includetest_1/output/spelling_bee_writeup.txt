In this assignment, I learned how to implement a Spelling Bee solver in Python. The assignment involved working with strings, file I/O, and implementing interactive features using a graphical library. I successfully completed the milestones including initializing the beehive with puzzle letters, displaying legal words, adding scores, and letting the user find words. The assignment provided valuable experience in decomposing problems into smaller, manageable tasks and developing Python code incrementally.
