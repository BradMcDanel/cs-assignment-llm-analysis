This project has been an eye-opening experience in understanding the use of real-world data to uncover societal issues. The process of extracting and analyzing data using Python has clarified how data-driven insights can reveal systemic patterns of inequality and injustice. The findings that black individuals are disproportionately affected in fatal police shootings, particularly when unarmed, are disturbing and call for deeper investigation and reform. Working with this dataset has enhanced my skills in data handling, dictionary manipulation, and using Python for meaningful analysis. It is a critical reminder of the importance of using technology and data for social good.
