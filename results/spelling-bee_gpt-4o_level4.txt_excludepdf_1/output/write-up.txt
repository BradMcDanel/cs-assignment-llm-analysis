In this assignment, I learned how to handle user input and validate it against given constraints. I also gained experience in reading from a file and processing its contents to match specific criteria. Implementing the scoring system and ensuring that the user interface updated correctly helped reinforce the importance of clear and consistent communication between different parts of the code.
