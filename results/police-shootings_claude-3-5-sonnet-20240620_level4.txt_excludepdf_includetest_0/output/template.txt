Task 1:
Question 1: The Washington Post's database contains records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015. The data is compiled from news reports, social media postings, and police reports. It includes details such as the race, age, and gender of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
- id: Unique identifier for each incident. Examples: 22, 325, 140.
- name: Name of the deceased. Examples: "John Doe", "Jane Smith".
- date: Date of the incident. Examples: "2015-01-02", "2016-07-15".
- manner_of_death: How the person died. Examples: "shot", "shot and Tasered".
- armed: Whether and how the person was armed. Examples: "gun", "knife", "unarmed".
- age: Age of the deceased. Examples: 25, 40, 17.
- gender: Gender of the deceased. Examples: "M", "F".
- race: Race of the deceased. Examples: "W" (White), "B" (Black), "H" (Hispanic).
- city: City where the incident occurred. Examples: "Los Angeles", "New York".
- state: State where the incident occurred. Examples: "CA", "NY", "TX".
- signs_of_mental_illness: Presence of mental illness signs. Examples: "True", "False".
- threat_level: Perceived threat level. Examples: "attack", "other", "undetermined".
- flee: Whether the person was fleeing. Examples: "Not fleeing", "Car", "Foot".
- body_camera: Whether body camera footage is available. Examples: "True", "False".

Question 3: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2020 Census)

Task 2:
Question 1: The database stores information from the following columns: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera.

Question 2: The 'id' column from the CSV file is used as the keys in the database.

Question 3: The type of the values in database is <class 'dict'>.

Question 4: Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a specific incident. For example, database['1'] might store:
{'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'manner_of_death': 'shot', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'M', 'race': 'A', 'city': 'Shelton', 'state': 'WA', 'signs_of_mental_illness': 'True', 'threat_level': 'attack', 'flee': 'Not fleeing', 'body_camera': 'False'}

Task 3:
Question 1: Based on the results, the proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject is higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population. While black people make up 13.4% of the U.S. population, they represent a larger percentage of fatal police shooting victims.

Question 2: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is even higher than both the proportion of black people in the United States population and the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. This suggests a significant disparity in the likelihood of unarmed black individuals being involved in fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Task 4:
Reflection: Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with real-world data using Python. I learned how to read and process CSV files, organize data into dictionaries, and perform analysis on the structured data. The process of investigating racial disparities in fatal police shootings was eye-opening and highlighted the importance of data analysis in understanding social issues. I found it challenging to work with incomplete data (e.g., missing race information for some entries) and realized the importance of data quality in drawing accurate conclusions. This project also emphasized the power of programming in quickly processing large datasets and extracting meaningful insights. Overall, this experience has deepened my understanding of both Python programming and the complexities of analyzing sensitive social data.
