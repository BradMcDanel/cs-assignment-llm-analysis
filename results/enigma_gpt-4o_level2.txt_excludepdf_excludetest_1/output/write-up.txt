The Enigma Project involved simulating the Enigma machine used in WWII by implementing its components in Python. The implementation followed the MVC pattern where the model was developed in Python. The key milestones included activating the keyboard, connecting keys to lamps, designing an EnigmaRotor class to handle rotor states, and implementing the encryption path using permutations. The final step was ensuring rotors advance correctly with each key press, simulating the historical functionality of the Enigma machine.
