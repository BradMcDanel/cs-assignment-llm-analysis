This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. The program selects a random word from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS as the target word.

2. The enter_action function checks if the entered word is in the word list. If not, it displays "Not in word list".

3. If the word is valid, it colors the squares:
   - Green (CORRECT_COLOR) for correct letters in the correct position
   - Yellow (PRESENT_COLOR) for correct letters in the wrong position
   - Gray (MISSING_COLOR) for letters not in the word

4. The keyboard keys are also colored accordingly, with the rule that once a key is colored green, it stays green.

5. The game checks for a win condition (all letters correct) or if the player has used all 6 guesses.

The implementation uses the provided WordleGraphics module for all UI interactions, including displaying messages, setting square and key colors, and managing the current row.

This version implements all basic Wordle functionality as described in the assignment. For further improvements, one could consider implementing some of the suggested extensions, such as using a more balanced word selection strategy or adding score tracking.
