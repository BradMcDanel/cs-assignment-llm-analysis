This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The game selects a random word from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS at the start.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function checks if the guessed word is in the word list.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list".

3. Color the boxes:
   - After a valid guess, it colors each letter box appropriately:
     - Green for correct position
     - Yellow for correct letter in wrong position
     - Gray for letters not in the word

4. Color the keys:
   - The virtual keyboard keys are colored to match the most significant color for each letter:
     - Green takes precedence, then yellow, then gray

Additional features:
- The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or after 6 guesses.
- It displays a congratulatory message on winning or reveals the word if not guessed.

This implementation provides a fully functional Wordle game as described in the assignment. It uses the provided WordleGraphics module for the UI and WordleDictionary for the word list.
