Task 4, Question 1:
This project highlighted the power of Python in analyzing real-world data and the importance of visualizing and understanding data structures like dictionaries. It was sobering to see the disparities in the data regarding fatal police shootings, particularly in racial representation. The process of dissecting the dataset, writing code to manipulate and extract meaningful insights, and reflecting on the societal implications of these findings was enlightening. It reinforced the value of data science in drawing attention to critical social issues. Through this project, I've reinforced my skills in Python programming and data analysis, gaining a deeper understanding of how data can be used to inform and influence public discourse.
