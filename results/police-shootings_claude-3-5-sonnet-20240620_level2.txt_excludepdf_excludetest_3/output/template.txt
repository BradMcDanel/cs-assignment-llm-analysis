Task 1:
Question 1: The data includes information on fatal police shootings in the United States since January 1, 2015. It is compiled by The Washington Post, which tracks more than a dozen details about each killing, including the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis.

Question 2:
[Include detailed answers for each column as per the instructions]

Question 3: According to the 2020 United States Census, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone. (Source: United States Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045222)

Task 2:
Question 1: The database stores information from the following columns: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera.

Question 2: The 'id' column from the CSV file is used as the keys in the database.

Question 3: The type of the values in database is <class 'dict'>.

Question 4: Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a specific fatal police shooting. For example, database['3'] might contain: {'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'manner_of_death': 'shot', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'M', 'race': 'A', 'city': 'Shelton', 'state': 'WA', 'signs_of_mental_illness': 'True', 'threat_level': 'attack', 'flee': 'Not fleeing', 'body_camera': 'False'}

Task 3:
Question 1: The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (calculated in the code) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black individuals are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings.

Question 2: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed (calculated in the code) is even higher than the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests an even greater disparity when considering unarmed subjects of fatal police shootings.

Task 4:
Reflection: This project has been eye-opening in terms of working with real-world data on a sensitive and important topic. I learned how to use Python dictionaries to organize and analyze complex datasets efficiently. The process of breaking down the data analysis into steps - from understanding the raw data to creating specific subsets and calculating proportions - helped me appreciate the power of programmatic data analysis. The results of the analysis are concerning, highlighting significant racial disparities in fatal police shootings. This project has reinforced for me the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues, while also making me aware of the limitations and potential biases in data collection and categorization.
