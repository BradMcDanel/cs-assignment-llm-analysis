In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game in Python, following the provided instructions. The game involves guessing a hidden five-letter word and receiving feedback on the correctness of the guess. The milestones included displaying the word, checking the user's input, coloring the boxes based on the guess, and coloring the keys on the virtual keyboard. I followed a step-by-step approach to ensure each milestone was completed before moving on to the next. Additionally, I ensured proper handling of uppercase and lowercase letters in the game.
