I have written test cases for the SpellingBee program using pytest and mocked the SpellingBeeGraphics class for isolated testing. 
- Each test case focuses on a specific functionality like puzzle initialization, solving, word entry validation, pangram identification, and score calculation.
- The test cases ensure that the program functions correctly and handles different scenarios appropriately.
