This program implements a DNA profiler that identifies individuals based on a DNA sequence and a database of known STR counts. The solution involves reading a CSV file and a DNA sequence file, calculating the longest run of STRs in the sequence, and matching the results against a database. The program utilizes Python's string manipulation capabilities and CSV handling to efficiently process the data.
