Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The dataset includes details of fatal police shootings in the United States, compiled by the Washington Post. It contains information such as the date, location, and demographics of individuals involved in these incidents. The data is sourced from public records, news reports, and social media.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. id: A unique identifier for each fatal police shooting. Examples include 3, 4, 5.
2. date: The date of the shooting. Examples include 2015-01-02, 2015-01-03, 2015-01-04.
3. threat_type: The type of threat perceived by the police. Examples include point, move, attack.
4. flee_status: Whether the subject was fleeing. Examples include not, car, foot.
5. armed_with: The weapon or item the subject was armed with. Examples include gun, knife, unarmed.
6. city: The city where the shooting occurred. Examples include Shelton, Aloha, Wichita.
7. county: The county where the shooting occurred. Examples include Mason, Washington, Sedgwick.
8. state: The state where the shooting occurred. Examples include WA, OR, KS.
9. latitude: The latitude coordinate of the shooting location. Examples include 47.246826, 45.4874214, 37.694766.
10. longitude: The longitude coordinate of the shooting location. Examples include -123.121592, -122.8916961, -97.280554.
11. location_precision: Precision of the location data. Examples include not_available, block, intersection.
12. name: Name of the subject. Examples include Tim Elliot, Lewis Lee Lembke, John Paul Quintero.
13. age: Age of the subject. Examples include 53, 47, 23.
14. gender: Gender of the subject. Examples include male, female.
15. race: Race of the subject. Examples include A (Asian), W (White), H (Hispanic), B (Black), O (Other).
16. race_source: Source of race information. Examples include not_available, public_record.
17. was_mental_illness_related: Whether the shooting was related to mental illness. Examples include True, False.
18. body_camera: Whether the incident was recorded by a body camera. Examples include True, False.
19. agency_ids: IDs of the agencies involved. Examples include 73, 70, 238.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
As of the latest data, approximately 13.4% of the United States population is Black. [Source: United States Census Bureau]

Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following information from the CSV file: name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys used in the database are the 'id' values from the CSV file, which are unique identifiers for each entry.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The values in the database are dictionaries. Each value (dictionary) contains information about a single police shooting entry, including keys such as name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database stores a dictionary with specific information about a shooting. For example, for an entry with ID 3, it might store:
{'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}

Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than their representation in the United States population, indicating a disproportionate impact.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is also disproportionately higher compared to their representation in the general population. This suggests that unarmed Black individuals are at a higher risk of fatal encounters with police compared to other racial groups and compared to the overall statistics of police shootings.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to utilize Python dictionaries to manage and analyze real-world datasets. The process of reading data from a CSV file and organizing it into a structured dictionary was insightful and highlighted the importance of data structures in programming. Analyzing the dataset with Python revealed stark disparities in the racial composition of individuals affected by fatal police shootings. This project also emphasized the importance of understanding data sources and their limitations, such as the lack of representation for multiracial individuals in the dataset. Overall, this project provided valuable experience in both data analysis and social context.
