In this assignment, we analyzed food webs to identify predator-prey relationships, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and the height of each organism. The code was structured into functions for each part of the assignment, ensuring modular and reusable code. Basic error checking was implemented, and the output was formatted as per the assignment guidelines. The program reads the data file provided as a command line argument, storing predator-prey relationships in a dictionary and performing the necessary analysis based on the requirements.
