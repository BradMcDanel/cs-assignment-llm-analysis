In this assignment, students are tasked with writing a Python program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs by comparing it with the STR counts of individuals in a CSV file. The program uses file I/O, string manipulation, loops, and algorithms to compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and match it with the individuals in the database. The assignment provides a practical application of algorithmic thinking in a real-world scenario related to computational biology and DNA profiling.
