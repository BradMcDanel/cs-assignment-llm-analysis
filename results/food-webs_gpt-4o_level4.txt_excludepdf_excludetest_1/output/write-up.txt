In this assignment, I learned how to handle and analyze data structures, such as dictionaries in Python, to represent complex relationships like food webs. I practiced reading from files, error handling, and working with command-line arguments. Additionally, I got more experience with breaking down a problem into smaller functions and ensuring code modularity and reusability. This project also reinforced the importance of algorithm design, especially in determining the heights of organisms in a recursive-like manner without using actual recursion.
