This implementation of Wordle meets all the requirements specified in the assignment:

1. It chooses a random word from the FIVE_LETTER_WORDS list.
2. It checks if the entered guess is a valid word in the list.
3. It colors the boxes appropriately:
   - Green for correct letters in the correct position
   - Yellow for correct letters in the wrong position
   - Gray for letters not in the word
4. It updates the colors of the keyboard keys.
5. It handles multiple occurrences of letters correctly.
6. It displays appropriate messages for invalid words, wins, and losses.

The code is structured to follow the milestones outlined in the assignment:

Milestone #1: The random word selection is done at the start of the game.
Milestone #2: The enter_action function checks if the guess is a valid word.
Milestone #3: The coloring of boxes is implemented in the enter_action function.
Milestone #4: The coloring of keyboard keys is also handled in enter_action.

The implementation uses the provided WordleGraphics module for all GUI operations, making use of methods like set_square_color, set_key_color, and show_message.

This solution provides a fully functional Wordle game that meets all the specified requirements and follows the suggested implementation strategy.
