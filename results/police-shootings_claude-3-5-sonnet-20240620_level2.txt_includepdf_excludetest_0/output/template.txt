Task 3:

Question 1:
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject is [insert calculated value here], while the proportion of black people in the United States population is approximately 13.4% (as of 2019 Census estimates). This shows that black individuals are overrepresented in fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2:
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject is [insert calculated value here]. This is higher than both the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%) and the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings ([insert value from previous question]). This indicates that black individuals are even more disproportionately represented in unarmed fatal police shootings.

Task 4:

Question 1:
Reflection (at least five sentences):
This project has been eye-opening in terms of understanding the racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Working with real-world data has shown me the importance of data analysis in uncovering societal issues. I was surprised by the extent of the overrepresentation of black individuals in these incidents, especially in unarmed shootings. The process of working with dictionaries to organize and analyze the data has improved my Python skills and shown me how powerful programming can be for processing large datasets. This project has also made me more aware of the need for transparency and accountability in law enforcement, and the role that data analysis can play in driving policy changes and public awareness.
