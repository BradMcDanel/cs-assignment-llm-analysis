In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game in Python. I followed the provided instructions and completed the required milestones for the game. The implementation includes choosing a random word, checking user-entered words, coloring the boxes based on correctness, and handling game-over conditions. Additionally, I created test cases using pytest to verify the functionality of the game implementation.
