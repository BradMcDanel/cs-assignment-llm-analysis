In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game in Python by following the provided milestones. I utilized the WordleDictionary and WordleGraphics modules to handle the word list and graphical interface, respectively. The game logic involved selecting a random word, checking user input, coloring boxes based on correct positions, and updating key colors. Each milestone was completed incrementally to ensure the game functionality was working correctly before moving on to the next step.
