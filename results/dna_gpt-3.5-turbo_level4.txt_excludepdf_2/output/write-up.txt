This program takes a DNA sequence and a CSV file containing STR counts for individuals, then identifies to whom the DNA most likely belongs based on the longest runs of consecutive repeats of the STRs in the DNA sequence. The program reads the CSV file and DNA sequence, computes the longest runs, and then checks for a match in the CSV file. If there is a match, it outputs the name of the individual; otherwise, it prints "No match".
