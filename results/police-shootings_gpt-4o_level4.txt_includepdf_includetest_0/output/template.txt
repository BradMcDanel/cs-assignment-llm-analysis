Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The data includes information on individuals who were fatally shot by police in the United States. It contains details about the date, location, demographics (such as age, gender, and race), and circumstances of each incident. The data is compiled and made publicly available by the Washington Post.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
- Column "id": Unique identifier for each incident. Examples: 3, 4, 5.
- Column "date": The date when the incident occurred. Examples: "2015-01-02", "2015-01-03".
- Column "threat_type": The type of threat perceived by the police. Examples: "point", "move".
- Column "flee_status": Indicates if the subject was fleeing. Examples: "not", "car".
- Column "armed_with": The weapon the subject was armed with. Examples: "gun", "replica", "unarmed".
- Column "city": The city where the incident occurred. Examples: "Shelton", "Aloha".
- Column "county": The county of the incident. Examples: "Mason", "Washington".
- Column "state": The state where the incident occurred. Examples: "WA", "OR".
- Column "latitude": Latitude coordinate of the incident. Examples: 47.246826, 45.4874214.
- Column "longitude": Longitude coordinate of the incident. Examples: -123.121592, -122.8916961.
- Column "location_precision": Precision of the location data. Examples: "not_available".
- Column "name": Name of the individual involved. Examples: "Tim Elliot", "Lewis Lee Lembke".
- Column "age": Age of the individual. Examples: 53, 47.
- Column "gender": Gender of the individual. Examples: "male", "female".
- Column "race": Race of the individual. Examples: "A", "W".
- Column "race_source": Source of the race information. Examples: "not_available".
- Column "was_mental_illness_related": Whether the incident was related to mental illness. Examples: True, False.
- Column "body_camera": Whether a body camera was used. Examples: True, False.
- Column "agency_ids": IDs of the agencies involved. Examples: 73, 70.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The percentage of the United States population that is black is approximately 13.4%. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2020)

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores information from columns: "name", "date", "armed", "age", "gender", "race", and "state".

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the incident IDs from the "id" column of the dataset.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing keys: "name", "date", "armed", "age", "gender", "race", "state". For example, for ID 3, it stores: {"name": "Tim Elliot", "date": "2015-01-02", "armed": "gun", "age": "53", "gender": "male", "race": "A", "state": "WA"}.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than their representation in the U.S. population, which is approximately 13.4%.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is even higher compared to their representation in the U.S. population, and it is also higher than the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to analyze real-world datasets using Python, particularly using dictionaries to organize and query data. The project highlighted significant societal issues, such as racial disparities in fatal police shootings. It was eye-opening to see the numerical representation of these disparities. Additionally, I practiced writing Python code to process CSV files and use dictionaries for data management effectively. This project underscored the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues.
