In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game in Python by completing various milestones. Each milestone focused on different aspects of the game, such as displaying the word, checking user input, coloring the boxes, and updating key colors. I followed a step-by-step approach to ensure each milestone was working before moving on to the next. This helped me understand the game mechanics and graphics handling better. Overall, it was a challenging yet rewarding experience to implement the Wordle game from scratch.
