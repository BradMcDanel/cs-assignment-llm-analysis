In this assignment, we implemented a Python program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs by comparing the STR counts from a CSV file with a given DNA sequence. The program reads the CSV file and the DNA sequence file, computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence, and matches it with the individuals in the CSV file. If a match is found, it prints the name of the individual; otherwise, it prints "No match". The program uses file I/O, string manipulation, loops, and algorithms to achieve this functionality.
