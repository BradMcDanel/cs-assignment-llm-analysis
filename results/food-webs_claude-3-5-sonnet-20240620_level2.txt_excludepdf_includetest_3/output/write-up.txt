This implementation follows the requirements outlined in the assignment:

1. It reads the food web file name from command line arguments or prompts the user if not provided.
2. It performs error checking for file existence and number of command line arguments.
3. The predator-prey relationships are stored in a dictionary as required.
4. The file is only read once.
5. Files are properly closed using a with statement.
6. The code is divided into appropriate functions for each part of the assignment.
7. There are no global variables used (except for imports and the main function call).
8. The code follows good programming style with appropriate variable names, comments, and function descriptions.
9. No break or continue statements are used.

The main data structure used is a dictionary where keys are predator names and values are lists of prey. This allows for efficient lookup and storage of the food web relationships.

For calculating heights, an iterative approach is used instead of recursion, following the algorithm provided in the assignment.

The format_list function from the provided module is used for formatting output lists.

This implementation should correctly handle the sample AquaticFoodWeb.txt file and produce the expected output for all parts of the assignment.
