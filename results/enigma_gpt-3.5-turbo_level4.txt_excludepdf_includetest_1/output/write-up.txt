In this assignment, I learned about the Enigma machine used during World War II and its encryption process. Understanding the Model-View-Controller pattern was crucial for implementing the interactive Enigma simulator. The assignment provided a valuable hands-on experience in designing classes, managing state, and implementing encryption algorithms. Overall, it was a challenging yet rewarding project that enhanced my programming skills.
