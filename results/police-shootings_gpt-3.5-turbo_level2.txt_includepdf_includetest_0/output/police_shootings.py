# This Python script reads data from the file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv and organizes it into a dictionary named database.
# Each entry in the database dictionary represents a fatal police shooting incident with attributes like name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state.

# Question 1:
# The information from the file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv that is stored in the database includes columns like name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

# Question 2:
# The keys in the dictionary database are the unique entry IDs of the fatal police shooting incidents.

# Question 3:
# The type of the values in the database dictionary is dictionary type. For example, type(database[123]) would return <class 'dict'>.

# Question 4:
# The values in the database dictionary store information about each fatal police shooting incident. For example, database[123] might store {'name': 'John Doe', 'date': '2022-01-01', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': 30, 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'W', 'state': 'CA'}.
