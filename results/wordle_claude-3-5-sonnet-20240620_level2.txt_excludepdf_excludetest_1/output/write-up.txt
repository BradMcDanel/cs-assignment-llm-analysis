This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The secret word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS and converted to uppercase.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function checks if the guess is 5 letters long and in the word list.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list".

3. Color the boxes:
   - After a valid guess, it loops through each letter to determine its color:
     - Green if the letter is in the correct position
     - Yellow if the letter is in the word but wrong position
     - Gray if the letter is not in the word
   - The colors are set using gw.set_square_color()

4. Color the keys:
   - The virtual keyboard keys are colored using gw.set_key_color()
   - Key colors are updated based on the most "correct" status of each letter

Additional features:
- The game ends with a congratulatory message if the word is guessed correctly
- If the player runs out of guesses, the secret word is revealed
- The current row is updated after each valid guess

This implementation covers all the basic functionality of Wordle as described in the assignment. For further improvements, the suggested extensions could be implemented, such as using a more balanced dictionary, enhancing victory animations, or adding a scoring system.
