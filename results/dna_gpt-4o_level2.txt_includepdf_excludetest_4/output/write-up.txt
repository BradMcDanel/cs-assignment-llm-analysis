This solution implements a DNA profiling algorithm that reads STR data from a CSV file and a DNA sequence from a text file to determine the most likely individual associated with the DNA sequence. The longest consecutive repeats of each STR are computed and matched against the database. The solution efficiently handles the input and uses string manipulation techniques to process the DNA sequence, adhering to the specified problem requirements.
