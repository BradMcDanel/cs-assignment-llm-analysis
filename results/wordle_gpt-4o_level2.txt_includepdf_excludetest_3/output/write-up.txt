This project implements a simplified version of the popular Wordle game. The game randomly selects a word from a list of five-letter words and displays a graphical interface where the user can guess the word within six attempts.

Milestone 1 involved selecting a random word and displaying it on the first row for testing purposes. Milestone 2 added functionality to check if the user's input is a valid word from the list and display a message accordingly. Milestone 3 implemented the core game logic of coloring the boxes based on correct, present, and missing letters in the user's guess. Finally, Milestone 4 enhanced the user experience by coloring the virtual keyboard keys based on the guesses, providing additional visual feedback to the player.

The project can be extended with various features, such as maintaining scores across games, enhancing graphics, or even adding new game modes.
