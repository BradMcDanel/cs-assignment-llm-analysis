This implementation satisfies the requirements of the assignment:

1. It reads the food web filename from command line arguments or user input if not provided.
2. It performs basic error checking when opening the file.
3. It stores predator-prey relationships in a dictionary as specified.
4. It only reads the file once.
5. It closes the file after reading (using a with statement).
6. It makes appropriate use of functions for each part of the assignment.
7. The only code outside of function definitions are import statements and the call to main().
8. It does not define functions inside other functions.
9. It does not use global variables.
10. It assumes the data in the file is correct.
11. It uses good programming style with appropriate variable names and comments.
12. It does not use break or continue statements.

The program implements all required parts:
- Part 1: Listing predators and their prey
- Part 2: Identifying apex predators
- Part 3: Identifying producers
- Part 4: Identifying most flexible eaters
- Part 5: Identifying the tastiest organisms
- Part 6: Determining the height of each organism in the food web

The implementation uses the provided formatting module to format lists correctly.

Areas for potential improvement:
- Adding more detailed error handling and input validation
- Implementing the A+ part (identifying herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores)
- Adding more comments to explain complex logic, especially in the get_heights function
