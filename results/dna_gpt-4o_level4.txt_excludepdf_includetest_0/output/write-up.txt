In this assignment, I learned how to manipulate strings and work with CSV files in Python. I implemented a program that reads a DNA sequence and a database of STR counts, computes the longest run of STRs in the DNA sequence, and matches the counts against the database to identify the individual. This assignment demonstrated the practical application of algorithms and string manipulation in computational biology.
