SpellingBee Project Write-up

1. Project Structure and Design:
   The project is structured around the main spelling_bee() function, which sets up the game and defines the callback functions for user interactions. The code is organized into smaller, focused functions to handle specific tasks, promoting readability and maintainability.

2. Milestone Implementation:
   - Milestone #1: The puzzle_action function checks if the entered puzzle is valid and updates the beehive letters accordingly.
   - Milestone #2: The solve_action function finds and displays all valid words for the current puzzle.
   - Milestone #3: Word scoring is implemented in the calculate_score function, and scores are displayed alongside words.
   - Milestone #4: The word_action function allows users to enter words, checks their validity, and updates the score.

3. Key Functions:
   - load_dictionary: Reads the dictionary file into a set for efficient word lookup.
   - is_valid_puzzle: Ensures the puzzle contains 7 unique letters.
   - find_valid_words: Identifies all valid words in the dictionary for a given puzzle.
   - is_valid_word: Checks if a single word is valid for the current puzzle.
   - calculate_score: Computes the score for a word, including the pangram bonus.
   - display_words and display_word: Handle the visual presentation of words and scores.
   - show_summary and update_score: Keep track of and display the overall game progress.

4. User Interaction:
   The program provides feedback through messages for various user actions, including setting the puzzle, solving, and entering words. Error messages guide the user when invalid inputs are provided.

5. Challenges and Solutions:
   - Efficient word checking: Using a set for the dictionary allows for fast word lookups.
   - Score tracking: Implemented a global total_score variable to keep track of the cumulative score.
   - Pangram detection: Achieved by comparing the set of letters in a word to the set of puzzle letters.

6. Possible Improvements:
   - Implement puzzle generation as suggested in the extensions.
   - Add a shuffle button to rearrange the outer hexagon letters.
   - Optimize for very large dictionaries by preprocessing or using more advanced data structures.

7. Conclusion:
   This implementation successfully meets all the requirements of the SpellingBee project, providing an interactive and engaging word puzzle game. The modular design allows for easy extension and modification, making it a solid foundation for further enhancements.
