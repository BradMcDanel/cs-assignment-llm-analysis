# Assignment 4 - Food Web Analysis
# Author: [Your Name]
# Student Number: [Your Student Number]
# Description: This program analyzes food webs from a provided CSV file. The program reads 
# the predator-prey relationships, stores them in a dictionary, and performs various analyses 
# including identifying apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, 
# and determining the height of each organism in the food web.

## Part 1: What do the Predators Eat?
# The program reads the predator-prey relationships from the input file and stores them in a 
# dictionary where the keys are predators and the values are lists of their prey. The program 
# then prints each predator and its prey in a nicely formatted manner.

## Part 2: Identify the Apex Predators
# An apex predator is defined as a species that is not eaten by any other species. The program 
# identifies and prints all apex predators.

## Part 3: Identify the Producers
# A producer is defined as a species that does not eat any other species. The program identifies 
# and prints all producers.

## Part 4: Identify the Most Flexible Eaters
# The most flexible eater is the organism that eats the greatest number of other organisms. The 
# program identifies and prints the most flexible eaters.

## Part 5: The Tastiest Organism
# The tastiest organism is the one that is eaten by the most different members of the food chain. 
# The program identifies and prints the tastiest organisms.

## Part 6: Determine the Height of Each Organism in the Food Web
# The height of an organism is defined as the longest path from that organism to a producer. The 
# program calculates and prints the height of each organism.

## Additional Notes
# - Command line arguments are used to specify the input file.
# - Basic error checking is performed to ensure the file exists.
# - Functions are used to modularize the code, each responsible for a specific part of the assignment.
