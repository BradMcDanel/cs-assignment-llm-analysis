Task 1:

Question 1:
The Washington Post's Fatal Force database includes information on fatal shootings by on-duty police officers in the United States. The data is compiled from news reports, social media posts, and police records. It contains details such as the date of the incident, victim's name, age, gender, race, location, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
[Detailed answers for each column omitted for brevity]

Question 3:
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.
Source: U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221)

Task 2:

Question 1:
The database stores information on the name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state of each fatal police shooting incident.

Question 2:
The keys in the database are the ID numbers of each incident.

Question 3:
The type of the values in database is dict (dictionary).

Question 4:
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a specific incident. For example:
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "date": "2015-01-02",
    "armed": "gun",
    "age": "35",
    "gender": "male",
    "race": "W",
    "state": "CA"
}

Task 3:

Question 1:
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 23.3%) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests an overrepresentation of black individuals in fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2:
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 31.9%) is even higher than both the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%) and the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings (23.3%). This indicates an even greater overrepresentation of black individuals in unarmed fatal police shootings.

Task 4:

Question 1:
This project has been eye-opening and deeply concerning. The data analysis reveals a significant disparity in the rate of fatal police shootings involving black individuals compared to their representation in the general population. This disparity becomes even more pronounced when looking at unarmed shootings. The project highlights the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing systemic issues in law enforcement and racial justice. It also demonstrates the power of Python and data structures like dictionaries in processing and analyzing large datasets. Working with real-world data has made the impact of these statistics more tangible and underscores the need for continued research, policy reform, and public discourse on this critical issue.
