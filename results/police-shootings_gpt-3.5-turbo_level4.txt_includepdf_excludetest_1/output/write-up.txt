In this assignment, I learned the importance of analyzing real-world data using Python and the significance of understanding the data before drawing conclusions. It was eye-opening to see the disparities in fatal police shootings and how these findings reflect broader societal issues. Working through this project provided valuable insights into data analysis techniques and the potential impact of using programming to explore such critical topics.
