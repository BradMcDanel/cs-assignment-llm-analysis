In this assignment, I learned about the complexity and ingenuity behind the Enigma machine used during World War II. By implementing the Enigma simulator, I gained a deeper understanding of how the rotors, reflector, and encryption process work together to create a secure communication system. The step-by-step approach of breaking down the task into milestones was incredibly helpful for handling such a complex system. Debugging and visualizing the mappings and permutations were crucial in ensuring the correctness of the simulation. Overall, this project was a fascinating exploration of historical cryptography and modern programming techniques.
