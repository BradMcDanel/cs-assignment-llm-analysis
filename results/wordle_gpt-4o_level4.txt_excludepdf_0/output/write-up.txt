In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game in Python by following a series of milestones. I started by displaying a random word in the first row of the game grid. Then, I added functionality to check if the user's guess is a valid five-letter word. Subsequently, I implemented the logic to color the boxes based on the correctness of the guessed letters. Lastly, I added the feature to update the colors of the virtual keyboard keys based on the letters guessed. This project helped me practice working with strings and implementing game logic in Python.
