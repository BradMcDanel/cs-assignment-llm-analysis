********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The information stored in the database from the file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv includes the following columns: name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the unique ID numbers from the 'id' column of the fatal-police-shootings-data.csv file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary that contains the following information: the name of the subject, the date of the shooting, whether the subject was armed, the age of the subject, the gender of the subject, the race of the subject, and the state where the shooting occurred. For example, a database entry might look like this:
{'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}


********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings, when compared to the percentage of Black people in the United States population, appears to be disproportionately high. With Black individuals making up 13.4% of the population, the data shows a higher percentage of Black subjects in fatal police shootings.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed also shows a disproportionately high rate compared to their representation in the general population. It further exacerbates the concern observed in the overall data, showing a likely disparity in the treatment of Black unarmed individuals compared to other races.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
This project has provided significant insights into the use of Python for data analysis, particularly in handling real-world datasets using dictionaries. The results of analyzing fatal police shootings reveal alarming disparities in the representation of Black individuals among those shot by the police, especially when considering unarmed subjects. The project emphasized the importance of careful data examination and the need for transparency and accountability in law enforcement practices. Furthermore, the task highlighted the challenges and limitations of datasets, such as the need for more comprehensive demographic categories. Overall, it was a valuable exercise in both technical skills and social awareness, reinforcing the role of data science in addressing critical societal issues.
