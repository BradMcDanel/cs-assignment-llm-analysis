This assignment involves creating a Spelling Bee puzzle solver using Python. The program interacts with a graphical interface provided by `SpellingBeeGraphics`. The main functionalities include validating the puzzle, finding valid words, calculating scores, and allowing users to input words.

The `SpellingBee.py` file contains the main program logic, while `SpellingBeeGraphics.py` handles the graphical display. The dictionary of English words is stored in `EnglishWords.txt`.

To test the program, run `test_SpellingBee.py` which includes test cases for various scenarios. Ensure all functions work correctly as per the assignment requirements.
