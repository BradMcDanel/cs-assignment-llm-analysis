In this assignment, I learned the importance of working with strings, lists, and text files in Python. I practiced implementing interactivity in a program and solving a complex puzzle by following a series of milestones. I also developed my skills in decomposing the problem, writing efficient code, and testing different components of the program. Overall, this assignment provided a great opportunity to enhance my programming skills and apply them to a practical project.
