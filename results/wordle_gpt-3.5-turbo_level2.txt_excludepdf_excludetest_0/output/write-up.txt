I have provided Python code blocks for implementing various milestones in the Wordle assignment. Each code block is specific to a milestone and utilizes the helper scripts provided in the assignment details. Milestones include picking a random word, checking user input, coloring the boxes, and coloring the keys based on the hidden word and guess. Ensure to test each milestone before moving on to the next to ensure proper functionality.
