Fatal Police Shootings

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 1, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The Washington Post has compiled a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The data comes from news reports, social media postings and police reports. The database is updated regularly and includes information about the race, age, and gender of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
id: Unique identifier for each shooting incident. Examples: 3, 4, 5.
date: Date of the incident. Examples: 2015-01-02, 2015-01-03, 2015-01-04.
threat_type: Type of threat posed by the subject. Examples: point, move, attack.
flee_status: Whether the subject was fleeing. Examples: not, car, foot.
armed_with: What the subject was armed with. Examples: gun, knife, unarmed.
city: City where the incident occurred. Examples: Shelton, Aloha, Wichita.
county: County where the incident occurred. Examples: Mason, Washington, Sedgwick.
state: State where the incident occurred. Examples: WA, OR, KS.
latitude: Latitude coordinate of the incident. Examples: 47.246826, 45.4874214, 37.694766.
longitude: Longitude coordinate of the incident. Examples: -123.121592, -122.8916961, -97.280554.
location_precision: Precision of the location data. Examples: not_available.
name: Name of the deceased. Examples: Tim Elliot, Lewis Lee Lembke, John Paul Quintero.
age: Age of the deceased. Examples: 53, 47, 23.
gender: Gender of the deceased. Examples: male, female.
race: Race of the deceased. Examples: A, W, H.
race_source: Source of the race information. Examples: not_available.
was_mental_illness_related: Whether mental illness was related to the incident. Examples: True, False.
body_camera: Whether body camera footage is available. Examples: False.
agency_ids: IDs of the agencies involved. Examples: 73, 70, 238.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores information from the following columns: id, name, date, armed_with, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the ID numbers of each incident, which are stored in the first column of the CSV file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in database is dict (dictionary).

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a specific incident. For example, an entry might look like this:
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "date": "2015-01-01",
    "armed": "gun",
    "age": "35",
    "gender": "male",
    "race": "W",
    "state": "CA"
}

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 23.2%) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black individuals are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 31.9%) is even higher than the proportion of black subjects in all fatal police shootings (23.2%), and significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This indicates that black individuals are even more disproportionately represented among unarmed subjects of fatal police shootings compared to both their representation in the general population and their representation in all fatal police shootings.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
Through this project, I learned several important things:

1. The power of using Python to analyze real-world data: By using Python dictionaries and basic programming concepts, we were able to process and analyze a large dataset efficiently.

2. The importance of data structure choice: Using dictionaries allowed for quick access to information and easy aggregation of data.

3. The significance of data analysis in understanding social issues: This project provided a concrete way to examine the disproportionate impact of fatal police shootings on black individuals.

4. The value of breaking down a complex problem into smaller tasks: By approaching the analysis step-by-step, we were able to build up to more complex insights.

5. The need for critical thinking when interpreting data: While the numbers show clear disparities, it's important to consider other factors and potential biases in the data collection process.

This project has deepened my understanding of both Python programming and the complexities of analyzing social issues through data.
