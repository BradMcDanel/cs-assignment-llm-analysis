Spelling Bee Project Implementation

This implementation of the Spelling Bee puzzle game covers all four milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Initialize the beehive with the letters in the puzzle field
   - The puzzle_action function checks if the entered puzzle is valid (7 unique letters) and sets the beehive letters if it is.

2. Display the legal words in the SpellingBee puzzle
   - The solve_action function finds all valid words for the current puzzle and displays them with their scores.

3. Add scores to the display
   - Words are displayed with their individual scores in parentheses.
   - Pangrams are shown in blue.
   - The total word count and score are displayed at the bottom of the window.

4. Let the user try to find the words
   - A "Word" field is added for user input.
   - The word_action function checks if the entered word is valid and updates the display and score accordingly.
   - Appropriate error messages are shown for invalid words.

Key features of the implementation:

1. Modular design: The code is broken down into smaller, focused functions for better readability and maintainability.

2. Efficient data structures: 
   - The dictionary is stored as a set for fast word lookups.
   - Found words are also stored in a set to prevent duplicates.

3. Reusable functions: 
   - is_valid_word is used both for solving the puzzle and checking user input.
   - calculate_word_score is used for both individual words and the total score.

4. User experience improvements:
   - The "Word" field is cleared after each valid word entry.
   - Detailed error messages are provided for invalid words.

5. Extensibility: The structure allows for easy addition of new features, such as generating puzzles or implementing a shuffle button.

This implementation provides a complete and interactive Spelling Bee game that meets all the requirements specified in the assignment.
