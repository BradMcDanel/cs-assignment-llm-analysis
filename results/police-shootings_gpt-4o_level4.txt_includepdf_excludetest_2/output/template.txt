********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The columns stored in the database are: name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the ID numbers from the fatal-police-shootings-data.csv file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database stores information about a shooting incident, including the subject's name, date of the incident, what they were armed with, their age, gender, race, and the state where the incident occurred.
Specific example: {'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than their representation in the United States population. This suggests a disproportionate impact on black individuals.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is also higher than their representation in the United States population. This is consistent with the overall trend observed in all police shootings, indicating a systemic issue.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to use Python dictionaries to analyze real-world data. The results of the analysis highlight the disproportionate impact of fatal police shootings on black individuals in the United States. This was evident both in the overall data and when focusing specifically on unarmed subjects. Working with the data also gave me valuable experience in data manipulation and analysis using Python. The project underscored the importance of using data to uncover and understand social issues.
