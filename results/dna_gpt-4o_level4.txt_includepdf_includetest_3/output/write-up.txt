In this assignment, I learned how to apply algorithmic thinking and string manipulation to solve a real-world problem: DNA profiling. This exercise demonstrated how computational biology problems can be tackled using programming, and I gained familiarity with file I/O operations in Python, specifically using the csv module for reading data from CSV files. I also learned about finding the longest run of a substring within a larger sequence, which is a useful algorithmic technique.
