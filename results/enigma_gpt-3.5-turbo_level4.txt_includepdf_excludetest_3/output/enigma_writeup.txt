In completing the Enigma project, I followed the milestones as outlined, implementing the Enigma machine simulator using the Model-View-Controller pattern. The project involved creating the EnigmaView, EnigmaModel, and EnigmaConstants classes to simulate the operation of the Enigma machine, including handling keyboard input, lamp display, rotor movement, and encryption path. I successfully completed all milestones, ensuring the interactive functionality of the Enigma simulator.
