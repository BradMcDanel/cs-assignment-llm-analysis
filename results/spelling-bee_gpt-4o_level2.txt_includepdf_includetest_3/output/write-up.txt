The Spelling Bee project involves creating an interactive puzzle game where users find words that meet specific criteria. The solution is broken down into milestones:

1. **Initialization**: We validate the puzzle input to ensure it contains exactly 7 unique letters, using the `puzzle_action` function.

2. **Word Validation and Display**: The `solve_action` function iterates over a dictionary of words, checking each against the puzzle rules: minimum length, use of the center letter, and presence in the beehive letters. Valid words are displayed with their scores.

3. **Scoring**: Words are scored based on length, with pangrams earning a bonus. The total word count and score are displayed.

4. **User Interaction**: Users can input words to validate against the puzzle. The system provides feedback and updates scores dynamically.

The project emphasizes modular design and refactoring, allowing for easy testing and extension. The `SpellingBeeGraphics` class handles GUI elements, while `test_SpellingBee.py` includes tests for validation and functionality using mock objects.
