# Description:
# This program analyzes a food web provided in a CSV file format. It reads the predator-prey relationships from the file,
# then performs various analyses on the food web such as listing predators and their prey, identifying apex predators,
# producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining the heights of each organism in the food web.

# I have followed the assignment instructions and divided the code into functions for each part of the assignment.
# The program reads the filename as a command line argument, performs basic error checking, and uses a dictionary to store
# the predator-prey relationships. It adheres to good programming style with appropriate variable names, comments,
# and function descriptions.

# To test the program, you can run it with a food web file as a command line argument. Make sure to provide the correct
# file format as described in the assignment instructions.

# Note: Remember to remove the 'sys.argv' line modification before submission.
