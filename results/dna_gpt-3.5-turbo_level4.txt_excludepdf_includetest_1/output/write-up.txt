In this assignment, students are tasked with writing a Python program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs by comparing the DNA sequence to a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals. The program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and match it with the individuals in the CSV file to determine the most likely owner of the DNA sequence. This assignment provides a practical application of algorithmic thinking and string manipulation in the context of computational biology.
