In this assignment, I learned about analyzing food webs and implementing functions to identify various relationships and characteristics of organisms within the food web. I successfully completed the tasks as outlined in the assignment, including listing predators and prey, identifying apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining the height of each organism in the food web. I also followed the guidelines provided for writing clean and structured code by breaking down the tasks into separate functions and ensuring proper error handling. Overall, this assignment enhanced my understanding of data structures and algorithmic thinking in the context of food webs.
