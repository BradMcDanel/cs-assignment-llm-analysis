In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game using Python, following the provided instructions step by step. The game involves guessing a hidden five-letter word within six attempts, with feedback provided for correct letters in the correct position, correct letters in the wrong position, and incorrect letters. The implementation included milestones such as displaying the word, checking the validity of the guessed word, coloring the boxes based on feedback, and updating key colors. Additionally, I wrote test cases to ensure the functionality of the game. Overall, the project was a great exercise in string manipulation and game logic.
