In this assignment, I learned how to handle CSV files in Python and process data using dictionaries. I also practiced using command-line arguments and error handling. The assignment challenged me to think about the relationships in a food web and identify different types of organisms based on their roles. I improved my skills in writing structured and modular code by organizing the program into separate functions for each task. Additionally, I explored the concept of recursion and iterative solutions to determine the height of organisms in the food web.
