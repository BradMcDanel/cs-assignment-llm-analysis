DNA Profiler Implementation

This program implements a DNA profiler that can identify a person based on their DNA sequence and a database of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) counts.

Key components of the implementation:

1. Command-line argument handling:
   The program expects two arguments: the CSV file containing the STR database and the text file containing the DNA sequence to analyze.

2. CSV file parsing:
   We use the csv module to read the database file into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person's STR profile.

3. DNA sequence reading:
   The DNA sequence is read from the provided text file into a string.

4. STR counting:
   The longest_match function is implemented to find the longest run of consecutive repeats for each STR in the DNA sequence. This function uses a sliding window approach to count consecutive matches efficiently.

5. Profile matching:
   The program compares the computed STR counts against each person in the database. If an exact match is found, it prints the person's name. Otherwise, it prints "No match".

Efficiency considerations:
- The longest_match function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the DNA sequence. This is more efficient than a naive approach that might have O(n^2) complexity.
- The program reads the entire DNA sequence into memory, which could be problematic for very large sequences. For real-world applications with longer sequences, a streaming approach might be more appropriate.

Potential improvements:
- Error handling could be enhanced, e.g., checking for file existence and proper formatting.
- The program could be modified to handle cases where multiple matches are possible, rather than assuming a unique match.
- Performance could be further optimized for very large databases or DNA sequences.
