- Column: "latitude"
  Explanation: Latitude of the shooting location.
  Examples: 34.0522, 40.730610.
  
- Column: "is_geocoding_exact"
  Explanation: Indicates if the geocoding information is exact.
  Examples: True, False.

Question 3.
According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 13.4% of the United States population is Black. 
(Source: United States Census Bureau, 2021)

Task 2: Reading the data into a dictionary

Question 1. 
The information stored in the database includes: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, body_camera, longitude, latitude, is_geocoding_exact.

Question 2. 
The keys in the database are the "id" values from the fatal-police-shootings-data.csv file.

Question 3. 
The type of values in the database is a dictionary. Each value is a dictionary containing the details of an individual shooting incident.

Question 4. 
For an entry in the database, it stores information such as the individual's name, age, race, whether they were armed, and other details about the shooting incident. For example, for the id '1694', it stores { 'name': 'George Floyd', 'age': 46, 'gender': 'M', ... }.

Task 3: Using the database

Question 1. 
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than their representation in the general U.S. population, which is approximately 13.4%.

Question 2. 
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a Black subject is still higher than their representation in the U.S. population. This also exceeds the proportion of Black subjects in all police shootings, indicating a disproportionate impact on Black individuals even when unarmed.

Task 4: Reflection

Question 1. 
In this project, I learned how to use Python dictionaries to organize and analyze real-world data systematically. The results highlight the disproportionate impact of police shootings on Black individuals. Working with such data brings awareness to societal issues and the importance of transparency and accountability. The project also reinforced the importance of data-driven insights in understanding and addressing complex problems. Overall, it was both an informative and eye-opening experience.
