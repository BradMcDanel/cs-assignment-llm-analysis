# Task 4 - Reflection
This project provided an opportunity to apply Python programming to analyze real-world data, highlighting the importance of using programming for social issues. I learned how to handle CSV files and utilize dictionaries to organize and analyze data efficiently. The results of the analysis were eye-opening, revealing disparities in fatal police shootings. While working with the dataset, I also acknowledged the limitations of the data, such as the lack of multiracial categories, which can influence findings. Overall, the project reinforced the value of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing societal problems.
