In this assignment, I learned how to implement a text-based interactive puzzle using Python. I practiced working with strings, text files, and array lists. Additionally, I learned how to structure a project using callback functions to handle user interactions. This assignment also emphasized the importance of breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable milestones. Through this approach, I was able to develop and test each part of the project incrementally, ensuring a more robust final solution.
