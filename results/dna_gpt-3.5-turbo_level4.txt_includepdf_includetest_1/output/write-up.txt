This assignment involved implementing a Python program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs based on a provided DNA database in CSV format. The program reads the CSV file and DNA sequence file, computes the longest run of consecutive repeats for each Short Tandem Repeat (STR) in the DNA sequence, and then matches it to an individual in the database. The program is tested using unit tests to verify the correct identification of individuals or the absence of a match.
