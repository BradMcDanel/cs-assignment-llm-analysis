This implementation fulfills the requirements of the assignment:

1. It reads the data file name as a command line argument or prompts the user if not provided.
2. It performs error checking when opening the file.
3. It stores predator-prey relationships in a dictionary.
4. It only reads the file once.
5. It closes the file after reading.
6. It makes appropriate use of functions for each part of the assignment.
7. The main program logic is contained within functions, with only the main() call outside.
8. It does not define functions inside other functions.
9. It does not use global variables.
10. It assumes the data in the files is correct.
11. It uses good programming style with appropriate variable names and comments.
12. It does not use break or continue statements.

The program implements all required parts:
- Part 1: Listing predators and their prey
- Part 2: Identifying apex predators
- Part 3: Identifying producers
- Part 4: Identifying most flexible eaters
- Part 5: Identifying the tastiest organisms
- Part 6: Determining the height of each organism in the food web

The implementation uses the provided format_list function for formatting output lists. It also follows the suggested algorithm for calculating heights in the food web.

This solution should meet all the requirements and produce the expected output for the given AquaticFoodWeb.txt file.
