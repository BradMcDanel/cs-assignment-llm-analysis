As of the latest data, approximately 13.4% of the United States population is black. [Source: U.S. Census Bureau - QuickFacts]

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores information from columns: "name", "date", "armed", "age", "gender", "race", and "state".

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys used in the database are the "id" values from the dataset.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing the keys "name", "date", "armed", "age", "gender", "race", and "state". For example, the value for ID 3 could be: {'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is higher than their representation in the United States population (13.4%).

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in unarmed fatal police shootings remains higher than their representation in the U.S. population and is also higher compared to their proportion in all police shootings.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to handle real-world datasets using Python, particularly focusing on dictionary usage for data organization and analysis. The process emphasized the importance of understanding the structure of data before processing it programmatically. I also gained insights into the social implications of data analysis, particularly in the context of racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Working with this data was eye-opening and highlighted the power and responsibility of data analysis in social justice issues. Overall, the project was an enlightening experience both technically and socially.
