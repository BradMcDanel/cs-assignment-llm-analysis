In this assignment, I implemented the Spelling Bee project using Python. The project involves working with strings, array lists, and text files to create an interactive puzzle that requires finding words based on specific rules. I followed the milestones provided to develop the functionality step by step, ensuring each milestone was completed before moving on to the next. The project also included handling user input, checking for valid words, displaying scores, and integrating user interaction with the puzzle. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding task that enhanced my programming skills.
