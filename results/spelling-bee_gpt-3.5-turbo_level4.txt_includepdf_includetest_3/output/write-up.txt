In this assignment, I implemented the Spelling Bee puzzle solver using Python. The program allows users to input a 7-letter puzzle and find valid words based on specific rules. The milestones were implemented step by step, ensuring the functionality of each part before moving on to the next. Unit tests were written to validate the behavior of the functions. Overall, the project provided valuable experience in working with strings, arrays, and file handling in Python.
