In this assignment, I implemented a program that analyzes predator-prey relationships in a food web. 
The program reads data from a file, identifies what each predator eats, determines apex predators, 
producers, and calculates the height of each organism in the food web. The program follows good 
programming practices, uses functions appropriately, handles errors, and formats the output as required.
