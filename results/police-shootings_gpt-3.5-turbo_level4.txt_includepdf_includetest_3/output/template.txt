Question 1:
The data includes information on fatal police shootings and is sourced from the Washington Post dataset available on GitHub.

Question 2:
- Column Headers: id, date, threat_type, flee_status, armed_with, city, county, state, latitude, longitude, location_precision, name, age, gender, race, race_source, was_mental_illness_related, body_camera, agency_ids
- Explanation: The 'id' column contains unique identifiers, 'date' includes the date of the incident, 'race' denotes the race of the subject, and so on.
- Examples: 
  - id: 3, date: 2015-01-02, threat_type: point, flee_status: not, armed_with: gun, city: Shelton
  - id: 4, date: 2015-01-02, threat_type: point, flee_status: not, armed_with: gun, city: Aloha

Question 3:

Question 1:
The information from the file that is stored in 'database' includes the columns: 'name', 'date', 'armed', 'age', 'gender', 'race', and 'state'.

Question 2:
The keys in 'database' are the unique identifiers of the fatal police shootings.

Question 3:
The type of the values in 'database' is dictionary.

Question 1:
In this project, I learned about the process of analyzing real-world data using Python dictionaries. It was interesting to investigate the representation of different races in fatal police shootings and compare it to the overall population demographics. This project highlighted the importance of data analysis in understanding complex social issues.
