The DNA profiling program reads a database of individuals with their respective STR counts and a DNA sequence to identify. The program calculates the longest consecutive repeats of each STR in the sequence and compares these counts with the database. If the counts match an individual, it prints their name; otherwise, it prints "No match". This solution effectively demonstrates how computational techniques can be applied to a real-world problem in computational biology.
