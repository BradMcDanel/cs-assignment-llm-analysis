Implementation details:

1. The program chooses a random 5-letter word from the provided FIVE_LETTER_WORDS list.

2. The secret word is displayed in the first row for testing purposes. This can be removed in the final version.

3. The enter_action function is called when the user presses Enter:
   - It checks if the guessed word is in the word list.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list" message.
   - If it is, it colors the squares and keyboard keys appropriately.

4. Coloring logic:
   - Green for correct letters in correct positions.
   - Yellow for correct letters in wrong positions.
   - Gray for letters not in the word.

5. The program keeps track of the current row and moves to the next row after each guess.

6. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or after 6 guesses.

7. Appropriate messages are displayed for winning or losing the game.

This implementation covers all the required milestones:
- Milestone 1: Picks a random word and displays it.
- Milestone 2: Checks if entered words are valid.
- Milestone 3: Colors the boxes based on the guess.
- Milestone 4: Colors the keyboard keys.

The code uses the provided WordleGraphics module for all graphical operations and adheres to the game rules as described in the assignment.
