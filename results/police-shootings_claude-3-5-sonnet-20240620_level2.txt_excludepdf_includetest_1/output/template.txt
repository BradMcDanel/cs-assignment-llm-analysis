Task 3, Question 1:
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (calculated as X.XX) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (approximately 13.4% according to recent census data). This suggests a disproportionate impact of fatal police shootings on the black population compared to their representation in the overall U.S. population.
