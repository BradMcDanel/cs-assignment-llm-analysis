In this assignment, I learned about implementing the Wordle game using Python. The assignment focused on working with strings and graphical elements to create an interactive Wordle game similar to the New York Times version. I found the milestone approach of breaking down the implementation into smaller achievable stages to be very effective. Each milestone built upon the previous one, leading to a gradual development of the game functionality. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding exercise in string manipulation and graphical interface design.
