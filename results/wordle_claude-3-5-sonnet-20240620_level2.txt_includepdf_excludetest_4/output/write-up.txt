This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The secret word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS at the start of the game.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function checks if the guessed word is in FIVE_LETTER_WORDS.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list" message.

3. Color the boxes:
   - After a valid guess, it loops through each letter to determine its color:
     - Green (CORRECT_COLOR) for correct letter in correct position
     - Yellow (PRESENT_COLOR) for correct letter in wrong position
     - Gray (MISSING_COLOR) for letters not in the word
   - It uses gw.set_square_color to update the colors of the squares.

4. Color the keys:
   - The keyboard keys are colored using gw.set_key_color:
     - Green for correct letters (never changes once set)
     - Yellow for present letters (unless already green)
     - Gray for missing letters

Additional features:
- Tracks the current row and moves to the next row after each valid guess
- Displays a congratulatory message if the word is guessed correctly
- Shows the secret word if the player runs out of guesses

The implementation uses the provided WordleGraphics module for all GUI operations and follows the game rules as specified in the assignment.
