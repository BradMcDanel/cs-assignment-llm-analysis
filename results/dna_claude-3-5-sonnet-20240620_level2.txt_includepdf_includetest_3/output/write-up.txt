Approach to solving the DNA profiling problem:

1. Command-line arguments:
   The program takes two command-line arguments: the CSV file containing the STR counts and the text file containing the DNA sequence.

2. Reading the CSV database:
   We use the csv module to read the CSV file into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person's STR profile.

3. Reading the DNA sequence:
   We read the entire DNA sequence from the text file into a string.

4. Finding the longest STR matches:
   We implemented a longest_match function that finds the longest consecutive run of a given STR in the DNA sequence. This function is called for each STR in the database.

5. Comparing STR counts:
   We compare the computed STR counts from the DNA sequence with each person's profile in the database. If all STR counts match exactly, we print the person's name and exit.

6. No match case:
   If no exact match is found after checking all profiles, we print "No match".

The longest_match function uses a sliding window approach to efficiently find the longest consecutive run of a given STR. The main function orchestrates the overall process of reading files, computing STR counts, and matching profiles.

This solution balances efficiency and readability, making it suitable for a CS1 or CS2 level assignment while demonstrating important concepts like file I/O, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking.
