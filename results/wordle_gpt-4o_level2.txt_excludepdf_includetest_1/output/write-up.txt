# Wordle Implementation Write-up

The implementation of the Wordle game follows a structured approach, focusing on milestones that build upon one another. 

1. **Milestone 1: Pick a Random Word**
   - The game begins by selecting a random word from the provided list of 5-letter words. This word is stored as `secret_word`.

2. **Milestone 2: Validate User Input**
   - When the user inputs a word, the code checks if the word is of correct length and exists in the word list. If not, an error message is shown.

3. **Milestone 3: Color the Boxes**
   - The program checks each letter of the guessed word against the `secret_word`. It uses two passes:
     - The first pass identifies letters that are in the correct position (green).
     - The second pass identifies correct letters in the wrong position (yellow), while marking used letters to prevent incorrect double counting.
   - The background colors of the letters are set according to their status (correct, present, or missing).

4. **Milestone 4: Color the Keys**
   - The virtual keyboard keys are also colored according to their status, providing a visual aid to the user.

5. **Game Progression and Termination**
   - The game progresses to the next row after each guess. It provides feedback via messages and ends if the word is guessed correctly or if the user exhausts all attempts.

This implementation captures the core mechanics of Wordle, providing a functional and interactive experience that mirrors the original game.
