In this assignment, we developed a Python program to identify an individual based on DNA sequences using STR (Short Tandem Repeat) profiling. By parsing a CSV file containing individuals' STR counts and computing the longest sequence of STRs in a given DNA sequence, we matched these counts to find the most likely individual. This exercise demonstrated practical applications of string manipulation, file I/O, and algorithmic thinking in computational biology.
