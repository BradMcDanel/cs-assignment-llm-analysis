This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The target word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS at the start of each game.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function first checks if the entered word is in the word list.

3. Color the boxes:
   - After a valid word is entered, the function checks each letter against the target word.
   - It updates the color of each square based on whether the letter is correct, present, or missing.

4. Color the keys:
   - The keyboard keys are also updated with appropriate colors after each guess.

Additional features:
- The game tracks the current row and moves to the next row after each valid guess.
- It displays a congratulatory message if the word is guessed correctly.
- If the player runs out of guesses, it shows a game over message with the correct word.

This implementation provides a complete, playable Wordle game that meets all the basic requirements specified in the assignment.
