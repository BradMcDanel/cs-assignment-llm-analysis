# I have implemented the Wordle game in Python following the provided instructions. 
# The code allows the user to enter a word and checks if it matches the hidden word from the list.
# The color of the boxes is updated based on correctness of the letters in the guess.
# I have also created a separate file, WordleExtensions.py, to work on possible extensions mentioned in the assignment.
