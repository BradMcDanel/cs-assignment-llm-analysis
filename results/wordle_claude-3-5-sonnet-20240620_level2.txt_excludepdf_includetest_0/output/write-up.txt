Implementation details:

1. The secret word is randomly chosen from the FIVE_LETTER_WORDS list and converted to uppercase.

2. The enter_action function is called when the user submits a guess:
   - It checks if the guess is valid (5 letters and in the word list)
   - If valid, it processes the guess letter by letter:
     - Compares each letter to the secret word
     - Sets the appropriate color for each square
     - Updates the color of the corresponding key on the virtual keyboard
   - Checks if the game is won or lost, and displays appropriate messages
   - Moves to the next row if the game continues

3. The main wordle() function sets up the game window and adds the enter_action listener.

4. The code includes a commented-out section to display the secret word in the first row for testing purposes.

This implementation covers all the required milestones:
1. Picks a random word (though doesn't display it by default)
2. Checks if entered words are valid
3. Colors the boxes based on letter correctness
4. Colors the keys on the virtual keyboard

Possible improvements and extensions:
- Implement a more balanced word selection algorithm
- Add animations for winning
- Create an option to list possible words based on previous guesses
- Implement a scoring system with file-based persistence
