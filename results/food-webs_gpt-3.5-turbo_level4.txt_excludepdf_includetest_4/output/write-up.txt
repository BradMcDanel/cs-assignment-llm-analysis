In this assignment, I learned how to analyze food webs by identifying predator-prey relationships, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining organism heights in the food web. I implemented functions for each part of the assignment, ensuring proper file reading, data storage, and analysis. Additionally, I followed the guidelines for good programming style, including appropriate variable names, comments, and the division of code into functions.
