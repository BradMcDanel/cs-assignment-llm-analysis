The SpellingBeeSolver.py script is designed to solve the Spelling Bee puzzle as described in the assignment. 
It loads the dictionary of English words, validates the user input puzzle, and then finds and displays the valid words 
along with their scores based on the puzzle rules. The script implements the required milestones in a modular and 
readable manner. Each milestone is tackled with specific functions and checks to ensure proper functionality and 
interactivity with the SpellingBeeGraphics class.
