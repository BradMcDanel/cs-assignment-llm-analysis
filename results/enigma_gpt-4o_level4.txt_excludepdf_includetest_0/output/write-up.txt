In this assignment, I implemented the Enigma machine simulator using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The main focus was on the model component, which handles the internal state and logic of the Enigma machine. This involved creating a data structure to track key states, lamp states, and rotor positions. I implemented methods to simulate pressing keys, releasing keys, and advancing rotors. The encryption logic was modeled after the original Enigma machine, utilizing permutations and reflectors to encode messages. This assignment provided insight into both historical cryptography and modern software design patterns.
