This implementation follows a modular approach, with separate functions for each major task in the assignment. The main data structure used is a dictionary to represent the food web, where keys are predators and values are lists of prey.

Key aspects of the implementation:

1. Error handling: The program checks for the correct number of command line arguments and file existence, providing appropriate error messages.

2. Data loading: The `load_food_web` function reads the file once and constructs the food web dictionary.

3. Analysis functions: Separate functions are implemented for each analysis task (apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and heights). These functions take the food web dictionary as input and return the required information.

4. Height calculation: The `calculate_heights` function uses an iterative approach to determine the height of each organism in the food web.

5. Output formatting: The program uses the provided `formatList` function to ensure correct formatting of output lists.

6. Main function: The `main` function orchestrates the overall flow of the program, calling each analysis function and printing the results.

This implementation should correctly process all provided food web files and produce output matching the expected format.
