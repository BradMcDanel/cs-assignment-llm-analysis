Task 1:
Question 1: This dataset, compiled by The Washington Post, contains detailed records of fatal police shootings in the United States since January 2015. The data includes information such as the name, date, and race of the person shot, along with the circumstances of the shooting.
Question 2: Columns include 'id' (a unique identifier for each incident), 'name' (name of the person shot), 'date' (date of the incident), and 'race' (race of the person shot), among others. Examples of values include 'id': 3, 'name': "Tim Elliot", 'race': "A" (Asian).
Question 3: According to the Census Bureau, as of the latest data, approximately 13.4% of the U.S. population identifies as Black or African American. Source: U.S. Census Bureau.

Task 2:
Question 1: The database stores all columns from the fatal-police-shootings-data.csv file such as 'id', 'name', 'date', 'race', etc.
Question 2: The keys used in the database are the 'id' values from the data.
Question 3: The type of the values in the database is dictionary, each containing details of a single shooting.
Question 4: One of the values in the database might be {'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'manner_of_death': 'shot', 'armed': 'gun', ...} representing detailed data of one incident.

Task 3:
Question 1: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than their representation in the general U.S. population.
Question 2: The proportion of unarmed black subjects in fatal police shootings is disproportionally high compared to their overall representation and compared to their representation in all fatal police shootings.

Reflection:
Reflecting on this project, I learned the power of data analysis in uncovering societal issues. The disproportionality in police shootings is striking and raises questions about systemic biases. Working with real-world data has enhanced my understanding of data manipulation and analysis using Python.
