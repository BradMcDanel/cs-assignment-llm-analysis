Introduction to Computer Science I
Project: Fatal Police Shootings
Overview
The goals of this project are to:
e Gain experience using Python to analyze real-world data.
e Practice using Python dictionaries.

In this project, you will use Python dictionaries to analyze real-world data on fatal police

shootings. You will use dictionaries to investigate whether black people are disproportion-

ately the subject of fatal police shootings, when compared with their representation in the
general United States population. Task 1 does not involve any Python programming. In-
stead, you'll gain familiarity with the data before you start working with it. For Task 2, you
will read and add comments to code that has been provided to you, reading data and orga-
nizing it into a dictionary. In Task 3, you will use the dictionary that we have constructed,
and write some additional code to answer questions about the data. Finally, in Task 4, you
will write a short reflection on your findings. As always, be sure to use meaningful variable
names and add helpful comments in your program.

Task 1: Understanding the data

For this project, you will use data on fatal police shootings that has been compiled by the

Washington Post, and is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/washingtonpost/

data-police-shootings, We have posted the data file, fatal-police-shootings-data.csv,

on the course webpage, to make it a bit easier for you to access.

Before you start working with this data using Python, it’s important to understand the data

that we’re working with. To do this, you will spend some time reading about the data, and

looking at the .csv file in a spreadsheet program such as Excel or Google Sheets. We have
provided a template file, template.txt, for you to record your investigations. In this file,
you will write your answers to the following questions:

Question 1. Follow the link|https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings
to read about the data. Write a three sentence summary of what is included in this
data, and where it comes from.

Question 2. Open the file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv in a spreadsheet program,
such as Excel or Google Sheets. For each column in the data file, answer the following
questions.

— What is the name of the column header? For example, the first one is “id”.
— Write one sentence explanation of what information is in this column.
1
— Give a few examples of the values in the column, and what they mean. For
example, some examples of values in the first column are 22, 325, and 140f]

Question 3. In order to compare the representation of black people among the subjects
of fatal police shootings to their representation in the general population, we need to
know the percent of the United States population which is black. You can find this by
googling racial demographics of the United States. Write the answer in the template
file, and include a citation.

Task 2: Reading the data into a dictionary

The next step for this project is to read the data from the file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv

using Python, and organize the data into a Python dictionary. This step has been done for

you, and is posted on the course webpage as the file police_shootings.py. Download
this file, and the .csv file containing the data, and save them in the same folder on your
computer.

For this task, you don’t need to write any code yet. Instead, you will add comments explain-

ing the code that has been provided for you, and answer questions about the structure of the

dictionary stored under the variable name database. In addition to reading the code, it can
be helpful to run the module, and then use print statements to investigate the structure of
the dictionary.

Add comments to the code in the file police_shootings.py, and answer the following

questions in project8_template. txt:

Question 1. What information from the file fatal-police-shootings-data. csv is stored
in database? That is, which columns from the . csv file are used? Refer to the columns
by name, not by number.

Question 2. What information from the file fatal-police-shootings-data.csv do we
use as the keys in database?

Question 3. What is the type of the values in database? Hint: you can fine this using
the line type (database [key]), where you replace key with an example of a key in
database.

Question 4. Looking at one of the values in database, what information does it store?
Give a specific example.

Task 3: Using the database
In this task, you will use Python and the dictionary database which has been created to ask
and answer questions about the data. To do this, you will write additional code in the file
police _shootings.py, continuing where the provided code ended, writing code to complete
the following tasks:
‘Note that this dataset allows only a small number of categories for race, and the dataset fails to recognize
that some people are multiracial. This is a weakness of the dataset.
2
e Print the name of the subject of the fatal police shooting with ID number 1694. If
you've followed current events in the past few years, this should be a familiar name.

e Print the name of all subjects of fatal police shootings in Minnesota in the dataset.
This will require iteration using a for loop.

e Create a new dictionary, called race_counts, which is initialized as an empty dictio-
nary, and built by iterating through database, and following an accumulator pattern.
The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of occurrences of each race
among subjects of fatal police shootings. The keys in this dictionary should be races,
and the corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.

e Print the fraction of fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a
number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of fatal police
shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary race_counts), by
the total number of fatal police shootings (how can you get this without hard coding?).

In the template file template.txt, answer the following question:

Question 1. How does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings compare
to the proportion of black people in the United States population?

Next, you'll restrict your focus to the fatal police shootings where the subject of the shooting

is unarmed, and find the proportion of these shootings with a black subject. To do this,

write code in the file police_shootings.py to complete the following tasks:

e Create a new dictionary called unarmed_selection, which is initialized as an empty
dictionary, and built by iterating through database, and following an accumulator
pattern. This dictionary should have the same structure as database, except it will
only contain entries for fatal police shootings where the subject was unarmed.

e Create a new dictionary, called unarmed_race_counts, which is initialized as an empty
dictionary, and built by iterating through unarmed_selection, and following an ac-
cumulator pattern. The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of
occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings, including only those
where the subject is unarmed. The keys in this dictionary should be races, and the
corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.

e Print the fraction of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should
be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of un-
armed fatal police shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary
unarmed_race_counts), by the total number of unarmed fatal police shootings (how
can you get this without hard coding’).

In the template file template.txt, answer the following question:

Question 2. How does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the
subject is unarmed compare to the proportion of black people in the United States
population? How does it compare to the proportion of black subjects in all police
shootings?

Task 4: Reflection
Question 1. For your final task of this project, write a reflection (at least five sentences)
on what you learned from this project, in the file template.txt. This can include your
reaction to the results of the project, as well as the process of working with the data.
This reflection will be graded for completion, not on the content of what you write.
