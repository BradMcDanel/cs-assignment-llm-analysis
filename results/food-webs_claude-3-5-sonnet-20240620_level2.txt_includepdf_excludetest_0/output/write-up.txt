This implementation solves the food web analysis problem as specified in the assignment. Here's a brief overview of the solution:

1. The program reads the food web data from a file specified as a command-line argument or prompts the user for a filename if not provided.

2. The food web is stored in a dictionary where predators are keys and lists of their prey are values.

3. The program implements separate functions for each analysis task:
   - display_predators_and_prey: Shows what each predator eats
   - find_apex_predators: Identifies species not eaten by any other
   - find_producers: Identifies species that don't eat any others
   - find_most_flexible_eaters: Finds predators that eat the most species
   - find_tastiest: Determines which species are eaten by the most predators
   - calculate_heights: Computes the height of each organism in the food web

4. The main function orchestrates the overall flow, calling each analysis function and printing results.

5. The program uses the provided formatList function to format output lists.

6. Error handling is implemented for file opening and command-line arguments.

7. The code follows good programming practices with appropriate comments, function decomposition, and avoidance of global variables.

This solution meets all the requirements specified in the assignment, including correct data structure usage, appropriate function definitions, error handling, and output formatting.
