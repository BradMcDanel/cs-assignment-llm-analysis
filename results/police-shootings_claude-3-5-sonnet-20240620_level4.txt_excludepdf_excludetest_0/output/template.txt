Task 1:
Question 1:
The Washington Post's Fatal Force database contains records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The data is compiled by Washington Post journalists through news reports, public records, social media, and other sources. It includes details such as the race, age, and gender of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
1. id: Unique identifier for each incident
   Examples: 22, 325, 140
2. name: Name of the deceased
   Examples: "John Doe", "Jane Smith"
3. date: Date of the incident
   Examples: "2015-01-02", "2016-12-25"
4. manner_of_death: How the person died
   Examples: "shot", "shot and Tasered"
5. armed: Type of weapon in possession of the deceased
   Examples: "gun", "knife", "unarmed"
6. age: Age of the deceased
   Examples: 25, 40, 18
7. gender: Gender of the deceased
   Examples: "M", "F"
8. race: Race of the deceased
   Examples: "W" (White), "B" (Black), "H" (Hispanic)
9. city: City where the incident occurred
   Examples: "Los Angeles", "New York"
10. state: State where the incident occurred
    Examples: "CA", "NY", "TX"

Question 3:
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.
Source: U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: United States (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045222)

Task 2:
Question 1: The database stores information from the following columns: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, and state.

Question 2: The ID column is used as the keys in the database dictionary.

Question 3: The type of the values in database is dict.

Question 4: Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a single incident. For example:
{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'date': '2015-01-02',
    'manner_of_death': 'shot',
    'armed': 'gun',
    'age': '25',
    'gender': 'M',
    'race': 'W',
    'city': 'Los Angeles',
    'state': 'CA'
}

Task 3:
Question 1: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings (calculated in the code) is higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black people are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is even higher than both the proportion of black people in the United States population and the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. This indicates an even greater disparity in unarmed fatal police shootings involving black subjects.

Task 4:
Reflection:
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with real-world data using Python. I learned how to read and process CSV files, organize data into dictionaries, and perform analysis on the structured data. The project highlighted the power of Python in handling large datasets and extracting meaningful insights.

The results of the analysis were eye-opening and concerning. The data showed a clear disparity in the representation of black people among the subjects of fatal police shootings, especially in cases where the subject was unarmed. This project emphasized the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues.

Working with this dataset also made me realize the complexities involved in collecting and categorizing such sensitive information. It highlighted the need for careful consideration of data categories and the potential limitations of simplifying complex identities into a few predefined categories.

Overall, this project not only improved my Python programming skills but also deepened my understanding of how data analysis can be used to shed light on important societal issues. It reinforced the idea that as data scientists and programmers, we have a responsibility to approach such analyses with care and consideration for the real-world implications of our findings.
