# The Enigma machine simulation was developed using a series of milestones,
# each building upon the previous. The design followed the Model-View-Controller
# (MVC) pattern, where the view and controller were provided, and the model
# was implemented to simulate the Enigma machine's functionality.
#
# The implementation included:
# 1. Keyboard activation to detect and record key states.
# 2. Connecting keys to lamps to visually display key presses.
# 3. Designing EnigmaRotor class to simulate rotor behavior.
# 4. Implementing letter permutation for encryption through rotors.
# 5. Completing the full encryption path including the reflector.
# 6. Implementing rotor advancement with carry logic.
#
# The Enigma simulation provides a simplified yet accurate representation
# of the historical machine used during World War II, demonstrating key
# concepts in encryption and decryption.
