This Wordle implementation follows the milestones laid out in the assignment. We select a random word from the provided dictionary and display it on the grid. User input is checked against the dictionary to ensure it's a valid word. The grid is colored based on the user's guess, indicating correct, present, or missing letters. Finally, the virtual keyboard is updated to reflect the status of each letter.

The game progresses row by row, and the user gets feedback on whether the guessed word is correct. The implementation respects the rules of Wordle, including handling duplicate letters carefully.

Possible extensions could involve adding a more balanced dictionary, enhancing graphics, or maintaining user scores across sessions.
