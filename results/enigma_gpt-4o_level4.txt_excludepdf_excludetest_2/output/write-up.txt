In this assignment, I learned the importance of understanding both historical context and modern design patterns. The Enigma machine was a crucial part of World War II history, and implementing a simulator for it using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern provided valuable insights into software architecture. By breaking down the problem into manageable milestones, I was able to incrementally develop a complex system, which is a critical approach in software engineering. Debugging and visualization played significant roles in ensuring the accuracy of the simulation, demonstrating the necessity of clear and thorough testing in the development process.
