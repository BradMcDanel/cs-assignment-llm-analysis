This implementation follows the requirements specified in the assignment. Here are some key points about the solution:

1. File reading: The program reads the file name from command line arguments or user input, and uses a try-except block to handle potential FileNotFoundError.

2. Data structure: The food web is stored in a dictionary where keys are predators and values are lists of prey.

3. Modularity: Each part of the assignment is implemented as a separate function, promoting code reusability and readability.

4. Efficiency: The file is read only once, and the resulting data structure is passed to other functions for analysis.

5. Error handling: The program checks for the correct number of command line arguments and handles file opening errors.

6. Output formatting: The program uses the provided format_list function to ensure correct output formatting.

7. Algorithm for heights: The program implements the iterative algorithm provided in the assignment to calculate the heights of organisms in the food web.

8. Style: The code follows good Python style guidelines, with appropriate variable names, comments, and function documentation.

This solution should meet all the requirements of the assignment and produce the expected output for the given example food web.
