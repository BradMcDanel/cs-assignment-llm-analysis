In this assignment, students write a Python program that accepts a CSV file representing a DNA database and a text file representing a DNA sequence. The program identifies to whom the DNA sequence belongs by computing the longest run of consecutive repeats of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) in the DNA sequence and comparing them with the data in the CSV file. The assignment involves algorithms, computational biology, file I/O, loops, and string manipulation, making it suitable for CS1 or higher students with familiarity with strings, lists, and exposure to Python.
