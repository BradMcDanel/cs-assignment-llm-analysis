This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The secret word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS at the start of the game.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function checks if the entered word is in FIVE_LETTER_WORDS.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list" message.

3. Color the boxes:
   - After a valid word is entered, it colors each letter box:
     - Green for correct position
     - Yellow for correct letter in wrong position
     - Gray for letters not in the word

4. Color the keys:
   - The keyboard keys are colored based on the guesses:
     - Green for correctly placed letters
     - Yellow for letters in the word but wrong position
     - Gray for letters not in the word
   - Key colors are updated to reflect the best information (e.g., green overrides yellow)

Additional features:
- Tracks the current row and moves to the next row after each valid guess
- Displays a win message if the correct word is guessed
- Shows the secret word if the player runs out of guesses

This implementation provides a fully functional Wordle game that meets all the basic requirements outlined in the assignment.
