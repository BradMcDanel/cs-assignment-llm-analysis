In this assignment, I successfully implemented a program to analyze food webs. The program reads predator-prey relationships from a file, stores them in a dictionary, and performs various analyses on the food web, such as identifying apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining the height of each organism. The program follows the specified format and structure outlined in the assignment guidelines.
