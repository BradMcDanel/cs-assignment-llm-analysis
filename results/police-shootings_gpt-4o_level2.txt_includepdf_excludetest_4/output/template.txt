********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following columns from the CSV file: "name", "date", "armed", "age", "gender", "race", and "state".

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the dictionary are the "id" values from the CSV file, which are unique identifiers for each shooting incident.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The values in the database are of type dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary that stores information about a shooting incident. For example, for ID 3, it stores: {"name": "Tim Elliot", "date": "2015-01-02", "armed": "gun", "age": "53", "gender": "male", "race": "A", "state": "WA"}.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the general U.S. population, which is 13.4%. This suggests a disproportionate representation of black individuals in these incidents.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of unarmed black subjects in fatal police shootings is also higher than their representation in the U.S. population. Compared to all fatal police shootings, unarmed black subjects also appear to be overrepresented.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
Working on this project has been an eye-opening experience. It highlights the importance of data in understanding social issues and can lead to important discussions about disparities in law enforcement. The technical skills gained in analyzing real-world data with Python are invaluable. The project also underscored the limitations of datasets and the need for careful interpretation. Overall, it was both a challenging and rewarding learning process.
