In this assignment, I successfully implemented a Spelling Bee solver in Python. The program allows users to input a 7-letter puzzle and find legal words based on specific rules. The solver utilizes a dictionary file to validate words and displays the legal words on the screen. Additionally, the program provides feedback to the user regarding the puzzle format and the words found. The solver is designed to handle various milestones, including initializing the beehive, displaying legal words, adding scores, and letting users find words interactively.
