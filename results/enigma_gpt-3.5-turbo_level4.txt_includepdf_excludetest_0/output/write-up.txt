In this assignment, I learned the importance of understanding the Model-View-Controller pattern in software design. The Enigma project provided a practical example of how to implement this pattern in a program. By following the milestones provided, I was able to simulate the operation of the Enigma machine, including the keyboard, lamps, and rotors. The assignment also emphasized the significance of proper code organization, separation of concerns, and incremental development to build complex systems effectively.
