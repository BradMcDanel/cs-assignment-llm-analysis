********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following columns from the CSV file: name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the IDs from the CSV file, which are unique identifiers for each shooting incident.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The values in the database are dictionaries containing the details of each shooting. Each value is a dictionary with keys: name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
An example value in the database for a specific entry might contain details such as: {"name": "Tim Elliot", "date": "2015-01-02", "armed": "gun", "age": "53", "gender": "male", "race": "A", "state": "WA"}.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings is higher than their representation in the general U.S. population. In the dataset, Black subjects are involved in approximately 23% of the shootings, whereas they make up about 13.4% of the U.S. population.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
When focusing on unarmed fatal police shootings, the proportion of Black subjects is even higher, around 32%. This indicates a significant disparity compared to their representation in the general population and also compared to the proportion of Black subjects in all police shootings.

Task 4, write your answers to the corresponding question.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
This project provided insight into the disproportionate representation of Black individuals in fatal police shootings in the United States. The analysis revealed that Black individuals are more frequently involved in these incidents, particularly when unarmed. This exercise also highlighted the importance of using programming skills to analyze real-world data and extract meaningful insights. The process of working with real datasets, cleaning data, and using Python dictionaries to organize and analyze data was a valuable learning experience. It underscores the critical role that data analysis plays in understanding social issues and driving informed discussions on policy and reform.
