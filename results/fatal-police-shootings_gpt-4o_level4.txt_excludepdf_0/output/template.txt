Task 1: Understanding the data

Question 1:
The data includes detailed information about fatal police shootings in the United States. It is compiled by the Washington Post and includes information such as the ID of the shooting, the name of the victim, the date of the shooting, the manner of death, and the race of the victim, among other details. The data is publicly available on GitHub.

Question 2:
Column Details:
1. id: A unique identifier for each shooting. Examples: 22, 325, 140.
2. name: The name of the person who was shot. Examples: "John Doe", "Jane Smith".
3. date: The date of the shooting. Examples: "2020-01-01", "2019-05-15".
4. manner_of_death: The manner in which the person was killed. Examples: "shot", "shot and Tasered".
5. armed: Indicates whether the person was armed. Examples: "gun", "knife", "unarmed".
6. age: The age of the person. Examples: 34, 22, 45.
7. gender: The gender of the person. Examples: "M", "F".
8. race: The race of the person. Examples: "W", "B", "H".
9. city: The city where the shooting occurred. Examples: "Los Angeles", "New York".
10. state: The state where the shooting occurred. Examples: "CA", "NY".
11. signs_of_mental_illness: Indicates if the person showed signs of mental illness. Examples: true, false.
12. threat_level: The perceived threat level. Examples: "attack", "other".
13. flee: Indicates if the person was fleeing. Examples: "Not fleeing", "Foot".
14. body_camera: Indicates if body camera footage is available. Examples: true, false.
15. latitude: The latitude of the location. Examples: 34.0522, 40.7128.
16. longitude: The longitude of the location. Examples: -118.2437, -74.0060.
17. is_geocoding_exact: Indicates if the geocoding is exact. Examples: true, false.

Question 3:
As of the most recent data, black people make up approximately 13.4% of the United States population. (Source: United States Census Bureau)

Task 2: Reading the data into a dictionary

Question 1:
The following columns from the .csv file are used in the database: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, body_camera, latitude, longitude, is_geocoding_exact.

Question 2:
The keys in the dictionary `database` are the values from the "id" column.

Question 3:
The type of the values in `database` is a dictionary.

Question 4:
Example of a value in `database`:
{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'date': '2020-01-01',
    'manner_of_death': 'shot',
    'armed': 'gun',
    'age': 34,
    'gender': 'M',
    'race': 'W',
    'city': 'Los Angeles',
    'state': 'CA',
    'signs_of_mental_illness': False,
    'threat_level': 'attack',
    'flee': 'Not fleeing',
    'body_camera': True,
    'latitude': 34.0522,
    'longitude': -118.2437,
    'is_geocoding_exact': True
}

Task 3: Using the database

Question 1:
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject compared to the representation of black people in the United States population shows that black individuals are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings. 

Question 2:
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject is higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population and also higher than the proportion of black subjects in all fatal police shootings.

Task 4: Reflection

Question 1:
In this project, I learned how to use Python for data analysis, particularly working with dictionaries to store and process real-world data. The analysis revealed the disproportionate representation of black individuals in fatal police shootings, highlighting significant social issues. Working with the data also taught me the importance of careful data handling and the insights that can be gained from such analysis. This project provided practical experience in reading and processing CSV files, organizing data into dictionaries, and performing statistical analysis. Overall, it was an enlightening experience that combined technical skills with important social implications.
