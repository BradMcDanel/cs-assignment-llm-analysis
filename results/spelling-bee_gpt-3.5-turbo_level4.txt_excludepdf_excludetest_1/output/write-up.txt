In this assignment, the Spelling Bee project was implemented in Python. The program allows users to input a puzzle consisting of seven unique letters and find valid words based on specific rules. The project was divided into four milestones:
1. Initializing the beehive with the letters in the puzzle field.
2. Displaying legal words in the Spelling Bee puzzle.
3. Adding scores to the display based on word lengths and pangrams.
4. Allowing users to try to find words and updating the score accordingly.

Each milestone required implementing specific functionalities and ensuring the program's interactivity. Proper error handling and user feedback were incorporated at each stage to enhance the user experience. Additionally, a utility script `dictionary_utils.py` was created to handle the English dictionary file for word validation.

The project provided valuable experience in working with strings, arrays, GUI elements, and file handling in Python. Understanding callback functions and milestone-based development proved effective in managing and completing the assignment successfully.
