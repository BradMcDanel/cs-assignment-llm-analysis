In this assignment, I implemented a Spelling Bee solver in Python using string processing and interactivity with the SpellingBeeGraphics library. The program allows users to enter a 7-letter puzzle and find valid words meeting specific criteria. The solver checks each word from the dictionary and displays legal words on the screen, including pangrams for extra points. Milestones were achieved incrementally, ensuring each part worked before moving on. The user can also input words to find and earn scores based on word length and pangram bonuses.
