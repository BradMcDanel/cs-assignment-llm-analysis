Question 1:
This project has provided significant insights into the use of Python for data analysis and the real-world implications of data on societal issues. Working with the dataset on fatal police shootings has been eye-opening, revealing the disparities in how different races are affected by police actions. By leveraging Python dictionaries, I was able to organize and analyze large amounts of data efficiently. The project also highlighted the importance of understanding data sources and limitations, such as the categorization of race. Overall, the task underscored the power of programming in uncovering truths within complex datasets.
