# This Python program identifies the owner of a DNA sequence by comparing it
# against a database of individuals with known short tandem repeat (STR) counts.
# It takes a CSV file with the database and a text file with the DNA sequence 
# as command-line arguments.

# The program first loads the database and DNA sequence into memory. It then computes
# the longest consecutive run of each STR in the DNA sequence. Using these counts,
# it attempts to find a match in the database. If the STR counts for an individual
# match the counts found in the sequence, the program outputs the individual's name.
# If no match is found, it outputs "No match".

# Key functionalities include:
# - Reading and parsing CSV and text files.
# - Calculating the longest consecutive repetition of a substring in a string.
# - Comparing calculated STR counts with those in the database for matching.

# This program is an application of algorithmic thinking and string manipulation
# techniques, demonstrating the intersection of computational biology and computer science.
