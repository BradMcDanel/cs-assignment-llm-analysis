In this assignment, I learned about the complexity of simulating historical cryptographic machines like the Enigma. Implementing the Enigma's rotor and permutation logic was a challenging yet rewarding task. This project provided valuable insights into both cryptography and the Model-View-Controller design pattern, emphasizing the importance of separating logic from presentation. The historical context added an interesting dimension, highlighting the significance of cryptography in wartime efforts.
