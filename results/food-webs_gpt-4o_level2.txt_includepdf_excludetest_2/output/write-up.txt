# This assignment implements a food web analyzer that reads a CSV file containing predator-prey relationships and processes this data to extract various insights. The insights include:
# 1. Displaying predators and their prey.
# 2. Identifying apex predators.
# 3. Identifying producers.
# 4. Identifying the most flexible eaters.
# 5. Identifying the tastiest organisms.
# 6. Calculating the height of each organism in the food web.

# The solution follows a structured approach:
# - The main script reads the file name from the command line or prompts the user.
# - It loads the food web data into a dictionary.
# - Functions are used to perform each part of the analysis, ensuring modularity and reusability.
# - The `formatList` function is used to format the output nicely.

# Key points:
# - The script handles errors such as file not found.
# - The use of sorting ensures consistent output order.
# - The height calculation follows an iterative approach to avoid recursion.
# - The solution is tested with different food web files to ensure correctness.

# The code adheres to good programming practices, including appropriate variable naming, comments, and function definitions.
