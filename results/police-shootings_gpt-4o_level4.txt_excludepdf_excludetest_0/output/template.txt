Task 1:
Question 1: The data includes information on fatal police shootings in the United States, compiled by the Washington Post. It records various details such as the date, location, and demographics of the individuals involved. The data is sourced from public records, news reports, and social media.

Question 2: 
- id: A unique identifier for each incident (e.g., 22, 325, 140).
- name: The name of the individual involved in the shooting (e.g., John Doe).
- date: The date when the shooting occurred (e.g., 2020-01-01).
- manner_of_death: The manner in which the individual died (e.g., shot, shot and Tasered).
- armed: Whether the individual was armed and with what type of weapon (e.g., gun, knife, unarmed).
- age: The age of the individual (e.g., 34).
- gender: The gender of the individual (e.g., M, F).
- race: The race of the individual (e.g., W, B, A).
- city: The city where the shooting occurred (e.g., Los Angeles).
- state: The state where the shooting occurred (e.g., CA).
- signs_of_mental_illness: Whether there were signs of mental illness (e.g., True, False).
- threat_level: The perceived threat level (e.g., attack, other).
- flee: Whether the individual was fleeing (e.g., foot, car, not fleeing).
- body_camera: Whether a body camera was present (e.g., True, False).

Question 3: As of the latest data, approximately 13.4% of the United States population is black. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2020 Census)

Task 2:
Question 1: All columns from the CSV file are stored in the database including id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera.
Question 2: The 'id' column is used as the keys in the database.
Question 3: The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.
Question 4: Each value in the database is a dictionary representing the details of a single shooting incident. For example, {'id': '22', 'name': 'John Doe', 'date': '2020-01-01', ...}.

Task 3:
Question 1: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population, indicating a disparity.

Question 2: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed also shows a disparity compared to their representation in the general population. It is crucial to acknowledge that this disparity is consistent with the overall data on police shootings.
