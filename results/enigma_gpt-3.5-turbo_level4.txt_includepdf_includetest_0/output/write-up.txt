In this assignment, I learned the importance of understanding the Enigma machine and implementing its simulation using Python. The assignment covered various milestones such as key pressing, rotor advancements, encryption, and decryption. It was a challenging but rewarding exercise in object-oriented programming and encryption algorithms.
