In this assignment, I have implemented the Enigma machine simulator following the provided guidelines. I have ensured that the key press, lamp lighting, rotor advancement, encryption, and decryption functionalities work correctly. I have also written test cases to validate the functionality of the EnigmaModel class. Overall, the Enigma simulator is now interactive and capable of encrypting and decrypting messages.
