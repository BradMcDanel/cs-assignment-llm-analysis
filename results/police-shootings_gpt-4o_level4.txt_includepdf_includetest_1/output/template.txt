Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
This project highlighted the importance and power of data analysis in understanding social issues. 
By working with real-world data, I learned how to use Python to organize and analyze datasets effectively. 
The disparity revealed by the data analysis was striking and underscored the need for addressing these issues. 
Additionally, it provided insight into how data can be structured and queried using dictionaries in Python. 
Overall, it emphasized the significant role of data science in societal awareness and reform.
