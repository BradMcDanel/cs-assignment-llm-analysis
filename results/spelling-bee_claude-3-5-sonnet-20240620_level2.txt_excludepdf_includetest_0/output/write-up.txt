Spelling Bee Project Implementation

This implementation of the Spelling Bee puzzle game follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Initialize the beehive with the letters in the puzzle field:
   - The puzzle_action function checks if the entered puzzle is valid (7 unique letters).
   - If valid, it sets the beehive letters and displays a success message.
   - If invalid, it shows an error message.

2. Display the legal words in the SpellingBee puzzle:
   - The solve_action function iterates through the dictionary and finds all valid words for the current puzzle.
   - It uses helper functions like is_valid_word to check word validity.
   - Valid words are added to the display using the add_word function.

3. Add scores to the display:
   - The calculate_score function determines the score for each word.
   - Pangrams are identified and displayed in blue.
   - The total score and word count are tracked and displayed.

4. Let the user try to find the words:
   - The word_action function handles user input for guessing words.
   - It checks if the word is valid, in the dictionary, and not previously found.
   - Valid words are added to the display and the score is updated.

Additional implementation details:
- The dictionary is loaded from the file and stored as a set for efficient lookup.
- The found_words set keeps track of words already discovered to prevent duplicates.
- The code is organized into smaller, reusable functions for better readability and maintainability.
- Error messages provide clear feedback to the user for invalid inputs or actions.

This implementation provides a complete and interactive Spelling Bee game experience, allowing both manual solving and automatic puzzle solving.
