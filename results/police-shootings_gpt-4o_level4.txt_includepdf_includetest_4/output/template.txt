- 'body_camera': If a body camera was present, e.g., True, False.
- 'agency_ids': Identifiers for the agency involved, e.g., 73, 70.

Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following information from the CSV: 'name', 'date', 'armed', 'age', 'gender', 'race', and 'state'.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys used in the database are the unique 'id' values from the CSV file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary, where each dictionary contains information about a specific incident.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
An example value in the database for ID 1694 would include: {'name': 'Philando Castile', 'date': '2016-07-06', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '32', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'B', 'state': 'MN'}.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than their representation in the general U.S. population. The fraction calculated was around 0.23, compared to 13.4% of the population.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of unarmed Black subjects in fatal police shootings is also disproportionately high. The fraction calculated was around 0.32, which is higher than both their general population representation and their representation in all fatal police shootings.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to work with real-world data and analyze it using Python dictionaries. By organizing data into a dictionary, I was able to efficiently perform operations like counting and filtering. The insights gained from this data were striking, highlighting a significant disproportion in the number of fatal police shootings involving Black individuals. This project underscored the importance of data analysis in understanding social issues and informed decision-making. It was also a valuable exercise in reading and interpreting CSV files, as well as using Python for data manipulation.
