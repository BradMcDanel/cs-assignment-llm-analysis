In this assignment, I learned how to implement a simplified version of the Wordle game using Python. 
The key components involved working with string manipulations, implementing logic to validate user inputs,
and using a graphical library to provide visual feedback to the user. Additionally, I understood the importance 
of planning and implementing the project in milestones, which made debugging and testing individual components 
more manageable. This project helped solidify my understanding of event-driven programming and the use of 
external libraries to enhance the functionality of a program.
