This project implements an analysis of food webs, identifying relationships such as apex predators, producers, and other ecological properties. The implementation follows a command-line interface where the user provides a CSV file containing predator-prey relationships.

The solution loads this data into a dictionary and processes it to determine:
1. What each predator eats.
2. Apex predators (those not preyed upon by others).
3. Producers (those that do not prey on others).
4. Most flexible eaters (those with the most diverse diet).
5. Tastiest organisms (those most commonly eaten).
6. The height of each organism in the food web (path to producers).

The code follows good practices by using separate functions for each part, ensuring modularity and readability. Error handling is implemented for command-line arguments and file operations. A test suite is provided to validate the program's correctness against expected outputs.
