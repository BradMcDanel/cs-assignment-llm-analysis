SpellingBee Implementation Explanation:

1. Dictionary Loading:
   - The dictionary is loaded from the file and stored as a set for efficient lookup.

2. Puzzle Validation:
   - The is_valid_puzzle function checks if the input puzzle has 7 unique letters.

3. Word Validation:
   - is_valid_word checks if a word is valid for the current puzzle, ensuring it's at least 4 letters long, contains the center letter, and only uses letters from the puzzle.

4. Scoring:
   - calculate_score implements the scoring system, giving extra points for pangrams.

5. User Interface:
   - puzzle_action handles setting the puzzle.
   - solve_action solves the puzzle, finding all valid words.
   - word_action processes user word inputs, validating and scoring them.

6. Display:
   - Words are displayed with their scores, and pangrams are shown in blue.
   - Running totals of words found and score are maintained and displayed.

This implementation covers all four milestones:
1. Initializing the beehive with puzzle letters
2. Displaying legal words in the puzzle
3. Adding scores to the display
4. Allowing user input for finding words

The code is structured to be modular and easy to understand, with separate functions for each main functionality. It uses the provided SpellingBeeGraphics class for all GUI operations.
