This implementation of the Spelling Bee game covers all four milestones:

1. Initialize the beehive with the letters in the puzzle field:
   - The puzzle_action function checks if the entered puzzle is valid (7 unique letters).
   - If valid, it updates the beehive display; otherwise, it shows an error message.

2. Display the legal words in the SpellingBee puzzle:
   - The solve_action function finds all valid words from the dictionary.
   - It displays each word with its score and highlights pangrams in blue.

3. Add scores to the display:
   - The calculate_score function computes the score for each word.
   - The total score and word count are displayed at the bottom of the window.

4. Let the user try to find the words:
   - The word_action function handles user input for guessing words.
   - It checks if the word is valid, already found, or has any issues.
   - Valid words are added to the display with their scores.

The code is structured with several helper functions to improve readability and maintainability:

- read_dictionary: Loads the word list from the file.
- is_valid_puzzle: Checks if a puzzle string is valid.
- is_valid_word: Determines if a word is valid for the current puzzle.
- calculate_score: Computes the score for a given word.
- update_score_display: Updates the score display at the bottom of the window.

The main spelling_bee function sets up the game state and GUI elements. It uses global variables for the dictionary, found words, and total score to maintain the game state across different actions.

This implementation provides a complete and interactive Spelling Bee game experience, allowing users to input puzzles, solve them automatically, or play the game by entering words manually.
