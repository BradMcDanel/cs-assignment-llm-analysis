In this assignment, we implemented a Python program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs by comparing the DNA sequence with a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals. The program computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and then matches it with the individuals in the CSV file. If there is an exact match, the program outputs the name of the individual; otherwise, it prints "No match".
