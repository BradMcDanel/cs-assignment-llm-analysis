********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 1, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The Washington Post's database contains records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The data is compiled from news reports, social media posts, and police reports. It includes details such as the race, age, and gender of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
id: Unique identifier for each incident. Examples: 3, 4, 5.
date: Date of the incident. Examples: 2015-01-02, 2015-01-03.
threat_type: Type of threat posed. Examples: point, move, attack.
flee_status: Whether the person was fleeing. Examples: not, car, foot.
armed_with: What the person was armed with. Examples: gun, knife, unarmed.
city: City where the incident occurred. Examples: Shelton, Aloha, Wichita.
county: County where the incident occurred. Examples: Mason, Washington, Sedgwick.
state: State where the incident occurred. Examples: WA, OR, KS.
latitude: Latitude of the incident location. Examples: 47.246826, 45.4874214, 37.694766.
longitude: Longitude of the incident location. Examples: -123.121592, -122.8916961, -97.280554.
location_precision: Precision of the location data. Examples: not_available.
name: Name of the deceased. Examples: Tim Elliot, Lewis Lee Lembke, John Paul Quintero.
age: Age of the deceased. Examples: 53, 47, 23.
gender: Gender of the deceased. Examples: male, female.
race: Race of the deceased. Examples: A, W, H.
race_source: Source of race information. Examples: not_available.
was_mental_illness_related: Whether mental illness was related. Examples: True, False.
body_camera: Whether body camera footage is available. Examples: False, True.
agency_ids: IDs of the agencies involved. Examples: 73, 70, 238.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores information from the following columns: name, date, armed_with (as "armed"), age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the ID numbers from the "id" column in the CSV file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in database is dict (dictionary).

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a single incident. For example:
{
    "name": "Tim Elliot",
    "date": "2015-01-02",
    "armed": "gun",
    "age": "53",
    "gender": "male",
    "race": "A",
    "state": "WA"
}

Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population. While black people make up 13.4% of the U.S. population, they account for a much larger percentage of fatal police shootings (the exact percentage will be calculated by the Python script).

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is even higher than the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. This suggests that unarmed black individuals are disproportionately more likely to be victims of fatal police shootings compared to both their representation in the general population and their representation among all fatal police shooting victims.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the power of data analysis in understanding complex social issues. Working with real-world data on fatal police shootings helped me appreciate the importance of careful data handling and interpretation. I was struck by the stark disparities revealed in the data, particularly regarding the overrepresentation of black individuals in fatal police shootings, especially when unarmed. This project also enhanced my Python skills, particularly in working with dictionaries and data manipulation. It highlighted the significance of data-driven approaches in addressing societal challenges and the need for continued research and action to address racial disparities in law enforcement interactions. Overall, this project underscored the intersection of technology, data science, and social justice, demonstrating how programming skills can be applied to analyze and shed light on critical issues affecting our society.
