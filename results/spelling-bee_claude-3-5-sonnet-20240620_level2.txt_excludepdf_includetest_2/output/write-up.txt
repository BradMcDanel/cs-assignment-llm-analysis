This implementation of the Spelling Bee game covers all four milestones:

1. Initialize the beehive with the letters in the puzzle field:
   - The puzzle_action function checks if the entered puzzle is valid (7 unique letters).
   - If valid, it updates the beehive display; if not, it shows an error message.

2. Display the legal words in the SpellingBee puzzle:
   - The solve_action function reads the dictionary, finds all valid words for the puzzle, and displays them with scores.
   - It uses helper functions like word_is_valid and calculate_score to determine valid words and their scores.

3. Add scores to the display:
   - Words are displayed with their scores in parentheses.
   - Pangrams (words using all 7 letters) are displayed in blue and receive a 7-point bonus.
   - The total word count and score are shown at the bottom of the screen.

4. Let the user try to find the words:
   - A "Word" field is added for user input.
   - The word_action function checks user-entered words for validity and uniqueness.
   - Valid words are added to the display with their scores, and the total score is updated.
   - Appropriate error messages are shown for invalid words.

The code is structured with several helper functions to improve readability and maintainability:

- read_dictionary: Reads the word list from the file.
- is_valid_puzzle: Checks if a puzzle string is valid.
- word_is_valid: Checks if a word is valid for the current puzzle.
- calculate_score: Calculates the score for a word.
- update_score_display: Updates the displayed word count and total score.

The implementation uses global variables (found_words and total_score) to keep track of the game state across different function calls. While this approach works for this small project, for larger applications, it would be better to use a class-based structure to encapsulate the game state.

The code handles both uppercase and lowercase letters appropriately, converting to lowercase for word checking and uppercase for the puzzle display.

Overall, this implementation provides a functional and interactive Spelling Bee game that meets all the requirements specified in the assignment.
