Introduction to Computer Science I
Project: Fatal Police Shootings
Overview
The goals of this project are to:
• Gain experience using Python to analyze real-world data.
• Practice using Python dictionaries.
In this project, you will use Python dictionaries to analyze real-world data on fatal police
shootings. You will use dictionaries to investigate whether black people are disproportion-
ately the subject of fatal police shootings, when compared with their representation in the
general United States population. Task 1 does not involve any Python programming. In-
stead, you’ll gain familiarity with the data before you start working with it. For Task 2, you
will read and add comments to code that has been provided to you, reading data and orga-
nizing it into a dictionary. In Task 3, you will use the dictionary that we have constructed,
and write some additional code to answer questions about the data. Finally, in Task 4, you
will write a short reﬂection on your ﬁndings. As always, be sure to use meaningful variable
names and add helpful comments in your program.
Task 1: Understanding the data
For this project, you will use data on fatal police shootings that has been compiled by the
Washington Post, and is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/washingtonpost/
data-police-shootings. We have posted the data ﬁle, fatal-police-shootings-data.csv,
on the course webpage, to make it a bit easier for you to access.
Before you start working with this data using Python, it’s important to understand the data
that we’re working with. To do this, you will spend some time reading about the data, and
looking at the .csv ﬁle in a spreadsheet program such as Excel or Google Sheets. We have
provided a template ﬁle, template.txt, for you to record your investigations. In this ﬁle,
you will write your answers to the following questions:
Question 1. Follow the link https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings
to read about the data. Write a three sentence summary of what is included in this
data, and where it comes from.
Question 2. Open the ﬁle fatal-police-shootings-data.csv in a spreadsheet program,
such as Excel or Google Sheets. For each column in the data ﬁle, answer the following
questions.
– What is the name of the column header? For example, the ﬁrst one is “id”.
– Write one sentence explanation of what information is in this column.
1
– Give a few examples of the values in the column, and what they mean.
For
example, some examples of values in the ﬁrst column are 22, 325, and 140.1
Question 3. In order to compare the representation of black people among the subjects
of fatal police shootings to their representation in the general population, we need to
know the percent of the United States population which is black. You can ﬁnd this by
googling racial demographics of the United States. Write the answer in the template
ﬁle, and include a citation.
Task 2: Reading the data into a dictionary
The next step for this project is to read the data from the ﬁle fatal-police-shootings-data.csv
using Python, and organize the data into a Python dictionary. This step has been done for
you, and is posted on the course webpage as the ﬁle police shootings.py.
Download
this ﬁle, and the .csv ﬁle containing the data, and save them in the same folder on your
computer.
For this task, you don’t need to write any code yet. Instead, you will add comments explain-
ing the code that has been provided for you, and answer questions about the structure of the
dictionary stored under the variable name database. In addition to reading the code, it can
be helpful to run the module, and then use print statements to investigate the structure of
the dictionary.
Add comments to the code in the ﬁle police shootings.py, and answer the following
questions in project8 template.txt:
Question 1. What information from the ﬁle fatal-police-shootings-data.csv is stored
in database? That is, which columns from the .csv ﬁle are used? Refer to the columns
by name, not by number.
Question 2. What information from the ﬁle fatal-police-shootings-data.csv do we
use as the keys in database?
Question 3. What is the type of the values in database? Hint: you can ﬁne this using
the line type(database[key]), where you replace key with an example of a key in
database.
Question 4. Looking at one of the values in database, what information does it store?
Give a speciﬁc example.
Task 3: Using the database
In this task, you will use Python and the dictionary database which has been created to ask
and answer questions about the data. To do this, you will write additional code in the ﬁle
police shootings.py, continuing where the provided code ended, writing code to complete
the following tasks:
1Note that this dataset allows only a small number of categories for race, and the dataset fails to recognize
that some people are multiracial. This is a weakness of the dataset.
2
• Print the name of the subject of the fatal police shooting with ID number 1694. If
you’ve followed current events in the past few years, this should be a familiar name.
• Print the name of all subjects of fatal police shootings in Minnesota in the dataset.
This will require iteration using a for loop.
• Create a new dictionary, called race counts, which is initialized as an empty dictio-
nary, and built by iterating through database, and following an accumulator pattern.
The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of occurrences of each race
among subjects of fatal police shootings. The keys in this dictionary should be races,
and the corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.
• Print the fraction of fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a
number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of fatal police
shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary race counts), by
the total number of fatal police shootings (how can you get this without hard coding?).
In the template ﬁle template.txt, answer the following question:
Question 1. How does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings compare
to the proportion of black people in the United States population?
Next, you’ll restrict your focus to the fatal police shootings where the subject of the shooting
is unarmed, and ﬁnd the proportion of these shootings with a black subject. To do this,
write code in the ﬁle police shootings.py to complete the following tasks:
• Create a new dictionary called unarmed selection, which is initialized as an empty
dictionary, and built by iterating through database, and following an accumulator
pattern. This dictionary should have the same structure as database, except it will
only contain entries for fatal police shootings where the subject was unarmed.
• Create a new dictionary, called unarmed race counts, which is initialized as an empty
dictionary, and built by iterating through unarmed selection, and following an ac-
cumulator pattern. The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of
occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings, including only those
where the subject is unarmed. The keys in this dictionary should be races, and the
corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.
• Print the fraction of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should
be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of un-
armed fatal police shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary
unarmed race counts), by the total number of unarmed fatal police shootings (how
can you get this without hard coding?).
In the template ﬁle template.txt, answer the following question:
Question 2. How does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the
subject is unarmed compare to the proportion of black people in the United States
population? How does it compare to the proportion of black subjects in all police
shootings?

Task 4: Reﬂection
Question 1. For your ﬁnal task of this project, write a reﬂection (at least ﬁve sentences)

This reﬂection will be graded for completion, not on the content of what you write.
