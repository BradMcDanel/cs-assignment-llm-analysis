This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The secret word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS and converted to uppercase.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function first checks if the entered word is in the word list.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list" and returns.

3. Color the boxes:
   - After validating the word, it loops through each letter of the guess.
   - It compares each letter to the secret word and sets the appropriate color:
     - Green (CORRECT_COLOR) for correct position
     - Yellow (PRESENT_COLOR) for correct letter in wrong position
     - Gray (MISSING_COLOR) for letters not in the word

4. Color the keys:
   - As it colors the boxes, it also updates the color of the corresponding key.
   - It ensures that a key's color is only "downgraded" (e.g., green doesn't change to yellow).

Additional features:
- Tracks the current row and moves to the next row after each valid guess.
- Displays a congratulatory message if the word is guessed correctly.
- Shows the secret word if the player runs out of guesses.

This implementation provides a fully functional Wordle game that meets all the requirements specified in the assignment.
