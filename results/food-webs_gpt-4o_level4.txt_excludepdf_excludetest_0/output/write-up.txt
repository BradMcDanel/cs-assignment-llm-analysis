In this assignment, I learned how to process and analyze data from a CSV file to identify relationships in a food web. The task required using dictionaries to store predator-prey relationships and implementing several functions to extract specific information, such as apex predators, producers, the most flexible eaters, and the tastiest organisms. I also learned how to compute the height of each organism in a food web using an iterative approach. The assignment emphasized good programming practices, such as error checking, function decomposition, and proper formatting of output. Overall, this assignment provided a comprehensive exercise in data manipulation and analysis using Python.
