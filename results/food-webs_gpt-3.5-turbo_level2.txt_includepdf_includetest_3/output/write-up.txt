# I have implemented the Assignment4.py script that reads the predator-prey relationships from a file, stores them in a dictionary, and performs various analyses on the food web data.
# The script follows the guidelines provided in the assignment handout, including reading the file name as a command line argument, using functions for each part of the assignment, error handling, and good programming style.
# The formatList.py script provides a function to format a list of items with commas and "and" for the last item, used in formatting the output for predators and prey.
# I have also included test cases using the pytest framework to ensure the correctness of the output generated by the script.
