In this assignment, I developed a Python program that takes a CSV file representing a DNA database and a text file representing a DNA sequence. The program computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) in the DNA sequence and identifies to whom the DNA most likely belongs based on the matching STR counts from the CSV file. The program uses file I/O, loops, and string manipulation to achieve this functionality. Finally, the program prints out the name of the individual to whom the DNA sequence most likely belongs or "No match" if there is no exact match found in the DNA database.
