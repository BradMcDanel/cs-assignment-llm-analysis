# Implementation of Wordle Game

The Wordle game was implemented by following a series of milestones:

1. **Milestone #1** involved selecting a random word from the provided dictionary and displaying it in the first row of the game window. This was achieved using the `set_square_letter` method from the `WordleGWindow` class.

2. **Milestone #2** required checking whether the entered word is valid by comparing it against the word list. The message "Not in word list" is displayed for invalid words.

3. **Milestone #3** added the functionality to color the boxes based on the correctness of each letter in a guess. This involved careful handling of letter usage to account for repeated letters in the target word.

4. **Milestone #4** extended the game by adding color coding to the virtual keyboard, giving players feedback on the letters they have used correctly, incorrectly, or partially correctly.

Further extensions could include more balanced word selection and enhanced graphics for a more engaging user experience.
