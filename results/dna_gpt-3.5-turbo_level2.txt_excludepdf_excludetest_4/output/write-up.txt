# The program 'profile.py' reads a CSV file containing STR counts for individuals and a text file containing a DNA sequence to identify the owner of the DNA sequence.
# It computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and matches it with the individuals in the CSV file.
# If a match is found, it outputs the name of the matching individual. If no match is found, it outputs "No match".
# The program can be executed using the command: python profile.py data.csv sequence.txt
