This implementation follows the requirements and structure outlined in the assignment:

1. The program reads the food web file name from command line arguments or user input.

2. It uses a dictionary to store the predator-prey relationships, with predators as keys and lists of prey as values.

3. The file is read only once in the load_food_web function.

4. Each part of the analysis is implemented in a separate function:
   - display_predators_and_prey
   - find_apex_predators
   - find_producers
   - find_most_flexible_eaters
   - find_tastiest
   - calculate_heights

5. The main function orchestrates the program flow, calling each analysis function in order.

6. The formatList function from the provided module is used for consistent output formatting.

7. Basic error handling is implemented for file opening.

8. The program follows good programming style with appropriate variable names, comments, and function structure.

9. No global variables are used (except for imports).

10. The program assumes the data in the input file is correct, as specified in the requirements.

This implementation should correctly analyze various food webs and produce output matching the examples provided in the assignment description.
