# This program analyzes food webs by reading predator-prey relationships from a file and storing
# them in a dictionary. It identifies what each predator eats, apex predators, producers, the most
# flexible eaters, the tastiest organisms, and calculates the height of each organism in the food web.
# The program follows guidelines such as command line parameter handling, error checking, and
# modular function design. Each part of the problem is broken into separate functions for ease of
# testing and potential reuse. The program also formats the output according to specified conventions.
