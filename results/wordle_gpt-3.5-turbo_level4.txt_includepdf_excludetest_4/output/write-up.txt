In this assignment, I learned the importance of milestone-based programming and working with strings in Python. I had the opportunity to implement a simplified version of the Wordle game, focusing on displaying words, checking user inputs, and coloring the boxes accordingly. By completing each milestone, I gained a better understanding of how to approach complex projects systematically and iteratively.
