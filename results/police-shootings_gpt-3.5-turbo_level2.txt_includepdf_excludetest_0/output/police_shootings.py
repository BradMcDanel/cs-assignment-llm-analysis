# The code reads data from the CSV file "fatal-police-shootings-data.csv" and organizes it into a Python dictionary.
# Each entry in the dictionary represents a fatal police shooting, with keys for name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state.
# The dictionary is structured with entry IDs as keys and nested dictionaries containing the details of each shooting as values.
