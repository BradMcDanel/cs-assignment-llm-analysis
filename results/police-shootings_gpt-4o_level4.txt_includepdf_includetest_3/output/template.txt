********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following columns from the CSV file: name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the dictionary are the unique 'id' values from the CSV file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database dictionary is a dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
Each value in the database is a dictionary that stores information about a shooting incident. For example, an entry might contain: {'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings is disproportionately high compared to their representation in the U.S. population. With the fraction calculated at 0.232, Black individuals appear to be overrepresented in these incidents relative to their 13.4% share of the total population.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in unarmed fatal police shootings is also disproportionately high. The fraction is approximately 0.319, indicating an overrepresentation compared to both the general U.S. population and their representation in all police shootings, which was 0.232.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
This project provided a revealing insight into the disparities in fatal police shootings, particularly concerning racial representation. Analyzing the data showed that Black individuals face a disproportionately higher risk of being involved in these incidents, both in general and when unarmed. The process of working with real-world data underscored the importance of accurate data handling and analysis to draw meaningful conclusions. Furthermore, it emphasized the critical role of data in informing discussions about societal issues and disparities. Overall, this project highlighted the power of programming and data analysis in shedding light on important social issues.
