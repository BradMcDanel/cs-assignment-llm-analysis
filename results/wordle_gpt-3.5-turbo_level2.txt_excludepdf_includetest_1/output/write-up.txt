The Wordle project involves implementing the popular Wordle game where the player needs to guess a hidden word within six attempts. The project provides milestones to guide the implementation process:

Milestone #1:
- Pick a random word from the provided list and display it in the first row of boxes.

Milestone #2:
- Check if the entered word is a legitimate English word and provide appropriate feedback.

Milestone #3:
- Color the boxes to indicate correct, present, or missing letters in the guessed word.

Milestone #4:
- Color the keys on the virtual keyboard to indicate used, found, or determined letters.

Each milestone builds upon the previous one to gradually implement the full Wordle game functionality. Extensions for further enhancements are also provided for future development.
