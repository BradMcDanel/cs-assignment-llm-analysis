This implementation of Wordle follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Pick a random word:
   - The secret word is chosen randomly from FIVE_LETTER_WORDS at the start of the game.

2. Check if entered word is valid:
   - The enter_action function checks if the guessed word is in FIVE_LETTER_WORDS.
   - If not, it displays "Not in word list".

3. Color the boxes:
   - After a valid guess, it loops through each letter to determine its color:
     - Green (CORRECT_COLOR) for correct letter in correct position
     - Yellow (PRESENT_COLOR) for correct letter in wrong position
     - Gray (MISSING_COLOR) for letters not in the word
   - Colors are set using gw.set_square_color()

4. Color the keys:
   - The keyboard keys are colored based on the guesses:
     - Green for correctly placed letters
     - Yellow for present letters (if not already green)
     - Gray for absent letters (if not already colored)

Additional features:
- Tracks the current row and moves to the next after each guess
- Displays a congratulatory message if the word is guessed correctly
- Shows the secret word if the player runs out of guesses

This implementation covers all the basic requirements of the Wordle game. It uses the provided WordleGraphics module for the UI and WordleDictionary for the word list. The game logic is implemented in the enter_action function, which is called each time the user submits a guess.
