# The `food_web_analysis.py` script reads a food web file, analyzes the relationships between predators and prey, and provides various insights such as listing what each predator eats, identifying apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining the height of each organism in the food web. The script uses the `formatList` function from `formatList.py` to format lists with proper commas and "and" before the last item.

# The script follows the guidelines provided in the assignment handout, reads the food web file specified as a command line argument, and ensures error checking for file existence. It divides the analysis tasks into separate functions for each part of the assignment, ensuring a structured and modular approach. The script outputs the results as specified in the assignment handout, providing a comprehensive analysis of the food web data.

# Overall, the script meets the requirements of the assignment by correctly analyzing the food web data, following good programming practices, and utilizing functions effectively to handle different aspects of the analysis.
