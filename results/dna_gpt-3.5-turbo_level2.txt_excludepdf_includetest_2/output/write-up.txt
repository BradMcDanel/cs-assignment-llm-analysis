This program reads a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals and a text file containing a DNA sequence to identify to whom the DNA belongs. It computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and matches it with the individuals in the CSV file. If there is an exact match, it prints the name of the individual, otherwise it prints "No match". The program uses command-line arguments to specify the input files and provides the result accordingly.
