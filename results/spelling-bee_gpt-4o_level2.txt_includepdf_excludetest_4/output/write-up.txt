# Spelling Bee Project Write-up

## Overview
The Spelling Bee project involves implementing a word puzzle game similar to the New York Times' Spelling Bee. The game requires users to identify valid words from a set of 7 unique letters arranged in a beehive format, with specific rules to follow.

## Implementation Steps

### Milestone #1: Initialize the Beehive
- Users can input a 7-letter puzzle.
- The program checks that the input consists of exactly 7 unique alphabets.
- If valid, the letters are set in the beehive display.
- If invalid, an error message is shown.

### Milestone #2: Display Legal Words
- Implemented a function to read from the dictionary file and validate each word.
- The word must be at least 4 letters long, contain the center letter, and only use the given beehive letters.
- Valid words are displayed along with their scores.

### Milestone #3: Scoring
- Scored words based on length, with a bonus for pangrams that use all 7 letters.
- The total score and number of words are displayed.

### Milestone #4: User Interaction
- Users can attempt to find words using a new input field.
- Each word is validated and scored as the user inputs.
- Duplicate entries are not allowed.

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable milestones.
- Using sets for quick membership testing, especially for dictionary lookups.
- The necessity of refactoring to accommodate new features, such as the user word input handling.

## Extensions
Future improvements could include generating random puzzles, implementing a shuffle feature for letters, and finding unique or challenging puzzles programmatically.
