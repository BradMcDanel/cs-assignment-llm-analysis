In this assignment, I learned about the intersection of computer science and biology, specifically how DNA profiling can be simulated using computation. By manipulating strings and using algorithms to find patterns, we can match DNA sequences to individuals in a database. This exercise enhanced my understanding of file I/O, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking in Python. The challenging part was accurately computing the longest run of consecutive repeats, which required careful iteration over the DNA sequence. This assignment also highlighted the importance of efficient algorithms in data processing tasks. Overall, it was a valuable experience in applying computer science concepts to real-world biological data.
