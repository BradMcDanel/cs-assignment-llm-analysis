# The provided solution is a Python program that identifies to whom a DNA sequence belongs
# based on a database of STR counts for different individuals. The program utilizes Python's
# CSV module to read the database into memory and then determines the longest consecutive
# repeats of specified STRs in a given DNA sequence. The key steps in the solution are:
#
# 1. Command-line Argument Handling: The program requires two command-line arguments: the path
#    to a CSV file containing the STR database and the path to a text file containing the DNA
#    sequence.
#
# 2. Reading Files: Using Python's file handling capabilities, the program reads the content
#    of both the CSV and the text files into memory.
#
# 3. Data Extraction: The STR sequences are extracted from the CSV's header, while the longest
#    run of each STR in the DNA sequence is calculated using a helper function `longest_run`.
#
# 4. STR Matching: The calculated STR counts are compared against each individual's counts in
#    the database. If a match is found, the individual's name is printed; otherwise, "No match"
#    is printed.
#
# 5. Efficiency: The solution is straightforward but could be optimized further for larger
#    datasets by employing more advanced algorithms for searching and matching.
#
# This program provides a practical example of applying computational techniques to solve
# problems in the field of computational biology.
