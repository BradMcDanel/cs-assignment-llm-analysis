In this assignment, I learned how to analyze and process food webs using Python. The assignment covered tasks such as identifying predators, prey, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and calculating the height of each organism in the food web. I implemented various functions to handle these tasks efficiently and followed the guidelines provided to ensure proper code structure and readability. Additionally, I used a provided utility script for formatting lists in a specific way. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding assignment that improved my programming skills in Python.
