# This Python script analyzes a food web described in a CSV file. 
# It reads predator-prey relationships, storing them in a dictionary, 
# and performs several analyses:
# - It lists what each predator eats.
# - Identifies apex predators (those not eaten by any other animal).
# - Identifies producers (those that do not eat any other animal).
# - Finds the most flexible eaters (those that eat the most different organisms).
# - Determines the tastiest organisms (those eaten by the most predators).
# - Calculates the height of each organism in the food web based on its distance from producers.

# The script follows good programming practices, with functions for each part
# to ensure modularity and reusability. It handles command line arguments
# and performs basic error checking for file existence.
