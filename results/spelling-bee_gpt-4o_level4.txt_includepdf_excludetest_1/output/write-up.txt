In this assignment, I implemented a Spelling Bee puzzle solver using Python. The project involved several milestones, including validating puzzle input, solving the puzzle to find all valid words, calculating scores, and allowing user interaction to input words and receive feedback. The SpellingBeeGraphics.py file was provided and used to handle the graphical interface, while the main logic was implemented in SpellingBee.py. I also ensured that the dictionary was loaded correctly from EnglishWords.txt. Through this project, I practiced working with strings, lists, and file I/O in Python, as well as creating an interactive user interface.
