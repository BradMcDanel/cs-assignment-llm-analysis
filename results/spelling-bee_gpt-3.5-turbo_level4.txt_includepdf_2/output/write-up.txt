In this assignment, I implemented the Spelling Bee project in Python. I followed the provided instructions to create a graphical user interface using the SpellingBeeGraphics class, allowing users to interact with the Spelling Bee puzzle. I implemented milestone functions to handle input validation, word checking, scoring, and word addition based on the rules of the Spelling Bee puzzle. The project involved string processing, array lists, and file handling in Python.
