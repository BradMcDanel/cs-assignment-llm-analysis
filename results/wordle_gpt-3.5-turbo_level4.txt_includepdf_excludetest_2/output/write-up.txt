In this assignment, the Wordle game implementation involves working with strings and graphics. The project aims to create a playable version of the Wordle game where users guess a hidden word within six attempts. Various milestones such as displaying the word, checking user input, coloring boxes, and keys are part of the implementation process. Extensions such as implementing a balanced dictionary, enhancing graphics, and keeping scores could be explored for additional functionality.
