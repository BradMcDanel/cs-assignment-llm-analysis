In this assignment, I learned about the Enigma machine, its components, and its encryption process during World War II. I implemented a simulator program using Python that simulates the operation of the Enigma machine, including the rotors, lamps, and encryption path. The program follows the Model-View-Controller pattern, separating the model component responsible for maintaining the state from the view and controller components handling the graphical representation and user interactions. The assignment provided insights into encryption techniques and the historical significance of codebreaking during wartime.
