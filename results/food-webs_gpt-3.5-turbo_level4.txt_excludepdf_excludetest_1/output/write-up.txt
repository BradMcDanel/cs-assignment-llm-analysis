In this assignment, I implemented a program to analyze food webs by identifying predators, prey, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining the height of each organism in the food web. I followed the guidelines provided and ensured proper error checking, data structure handling, and function design. Overall, the assignment helped me understand the complexities of food web analysis and the importance of structuring code effectively.
