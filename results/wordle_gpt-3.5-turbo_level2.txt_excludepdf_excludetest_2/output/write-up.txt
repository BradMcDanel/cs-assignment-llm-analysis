The Wordle assignment involves implementing the Wordle game in Python by following a series of milestones. The provided starter files include Wordle.py, WordleDictionary.py, and WordleGraphics.py. The main goal is to allow the player to guess a five-letter word and provide feedback based on correct letters and positions.

Milestones:
1. Pick a random word and display it in the first row of boxes.
2. Check whether the entered word is legitimate.
3. Color the boxes based on correct letters and positions.
4. Color the keys to track input letters.

The assignment also suggests possible extensions to enhance the game, such as creating a balanced dictionary, improving word selection strategies, enhancing graphics for wins, providing a list of possible words based on previous guesses, and keeping score in a file.
