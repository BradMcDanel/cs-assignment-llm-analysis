# This program analyzes food webs from a CSV file describing predator-prey relationships.
# It identifies relationships such as what predators eat, apex predators, producers,
# most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and calculates the height of each organism in the web.
# Each feature is implemented as a separate function to ensure modularity and clarity.
