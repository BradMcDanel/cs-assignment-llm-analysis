## Question 3
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Black or African American population in the United States is approximately 13.4%. (Source: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225219)

# Task 2
## Question 1
The following columns from the .csv file are stored in the database: 'id', 'name', 'date', 'manner_of_death', 'armed', 'age', 'gender', 'race', 'city', 'state', 'signs_of_mental_illness', 'threat_level', 'flee', 'body_camera', 'longitude', and 'latitude'.

## Question 2
The 'id' field from the .csv file is used as the keys in the database.

## Question 3
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

## Question 4
Each value in the database stores the information of a fatal police shooting, with each key-value pair in the dictionary representing a column from the .csv file. For example, the value for key `1694` includes:
{
    'id': '1694',
    'name': 'George Floyd',
    'date': '2020-05-25',
    'manner_of_death': 'shot',
    'armed': 'unarmed',
    'age': '46',
    'gender': 'M',
    'race': 'B',
    'city': 'Minneapolis',
    'state': 'MN',
    'signs_of_mental_illness': 'False',
    'threat_level': 'attack',
    'flee': 'Not fleeing',
    'body_camera': 'True',
    'longitude': '-93.265',
    'latitude': '44.9778'
}

# Task 3
## Question 1
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 0.25) is significantly higher than the representation of black people in the United States population (13.4%).

## Question 2
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 0.36) is also higher than the representation of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This proportion is also higher compared to the proportion of all fatal police shootings with a black subject (0.25).

# Task 4
## Question 1
In this project, I learned how to analyze real-world data using Python dictionaries. It was eye-opening to see the disparity in the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population. I also gained experience in reading and processing CSV files, and organizing the data into a dictionary for further analysis. Additionally, I practiced using Python to compute various statistics and answer specific questions about the data. Overall, this project highlighted the importance of data analysis in uncovering social issues and disparities.
