In this assignment, we implemented a Python program to solve the Spelling Bee puzzle, focusing on string processing and interactivity. The program allows the user to input a set of seven letters representing the puzzle and then finds legal English words that can be formed based on certain rules. The program displays the words found, calculates scores, and highlights any pangrams discovered. We utilized callback functions to handle user interactions and decomposition to manage the complexity of the project.
