# The Python script food_web_analysis.py reads a food web file provided as a command line argument, processes the predator-prey relationships, and performs various analyses as described in the assignment.

# The script consists of separate functions for each part of the assignment, ensuring modularity and readability. It utilizes the formatList function from the provided script formatList.py for formatting the output in Part 1.

# The main function reads the file, calls each part function sequentially to analyze the food web data, and prints the results as per the assignment requirements.

# The script handles basic error checking for file existence and follows good programming practices such as using functions for different tasks, avoiding global variables, and providing clear comments for each function.

# The output of each part is formatted as specified in the assignment, showing the predators and their prey, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and the heights of each organism in the food web.

# Overall, the script provides a comprehensive analysis of the food web data and meets the requirements outlined in the assignment document.
