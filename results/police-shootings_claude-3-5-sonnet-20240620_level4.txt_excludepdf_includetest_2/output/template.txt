Task 1:
Question 1:
The data includes information on fatal police shootings in the United States since January 1, 2015. It is compiled by The Washington Post, which has been tracking these shootings through news reports, public records, social media, and other sources. The database is updated regularly and contains details about each incident, including the race, gender, and age of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
1. id: Unique identifier for each incident. Examples: 22, 325, 140.
2. name: Name of the deceased. Examples: "John Doe", "Jane Smith".
3. date: Date of the incident. Examples: "2015-01-02", "2016-07-15".
4. manner_of_death: How the person died. Examples: "shot", "shot and Tasered".
5. armed: Whether and how the person was armed. Examples: "gun", "knife", "unarmed".
6. age: Age of the deceased. Examples: 25, 40, 17.
7. gender: Gender of the deceased. Examples: "M", "F".
8. race: Race of the deceased. Examples: "W" (White), "B" (Black), "H" (Hispanic).
9. city: City where the incident occurred. Examples: "Los Angeles", "New York".
10. state: State where the incident occurred. Examples: "CA", "NY", "TX".
11. signs_of_mental_illness: Whether the person showed signs of mental illness. Examples: "True", "False".
12. threat_level: The level of threat posed by the deceased. Examples: "attack", "other", "undetermined".
13. flee: Whether the person was fleeing at the time. Examples: "Not fleeing", "Car", "Foot".
14. body_camera: Whether officers were wearing body cameras. Examples: "True", "False".

Question 3:
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population is Black or African American alone.

Task 2:
Question 1: The database stores information from all columns in the CSV file: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera.

Question 2: The 'id' column from the CSV file is used as the keys in the database dictionary.

Question 3: The type of the values in database is dict. Each value is itself a dictionary containing information about a specific incident.

Question 4: Each value in the database stores a dictionary with the following information: name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera. For example, database['1'] might contain: {'name': 'John Doe', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'manner_of_death': 'shot', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '36', 'gender': 'M', 'race': 'W', 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'state': 'CA', 'signs_of_mental_illness': 'False', 'threat_level': 'attack', 'flee': 'Not fleeing', 'body_camera': 'False'}

Task 3:
Question 1: The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (as calculated by the program) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black people are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2: The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed is even higher than the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black people are even more disproportionately represented among unarmed subjects of fatal police shootings.

Task 4:
Reflection:
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with real-world data using Python. I learned how to read and process data from a CSV file, organize it into a dictionary structure, and perform various analyses on it. The process of working with this data was eye-opening, as it revealed stark disparities in fatal police shootings based on race.

I was particularly struck by the disproportionate representation of black individuals in these incidents, especially in cases where the subject was unarmed. This project highlighted the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues. It also demonstrated how programming skills can be applied to process and interpret large datasets, potentially contributing to important discussions and policy decisions.

The project also reinforced my understanding of Python dictionaries and their utility in organizing and analyzing complex data. I found the process of breaking down the problem into smaller tasks and implementing them step-by-step to be an effective approach to tackling this complex issue.

Overall, this project not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my awareness of a critical social issue, demonstrating the power of data analysis in shedding light on important societal problems.
