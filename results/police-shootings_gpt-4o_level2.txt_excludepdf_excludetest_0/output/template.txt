# Reflection
Through this project, I learned how to utilize Python dictionaries to analyze real-world datasets, specifically focusing on fatal police shootings. The process of working with this data highlighted the disparities in racial representation among subjects of these incidents. I found it especially striking that the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings, both armed and unarmed, was significantly higher than their representation in the general population. This task not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of social issues reflected in data. The exercise of writing Python scripts to manipulate and analyze data was educational and thought-provoking.
