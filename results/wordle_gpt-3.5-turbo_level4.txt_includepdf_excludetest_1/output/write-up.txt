In this assignment, the Wordle game implementation involved working with strings, graphics, and user input. The project was broken down into milestones to ensure a systematic approach to completion. The game required picking a random word, checking user-entered words, coloring boxes based on correctness, and coloring keys for user feedback. Additionally, possible extensions for the game were suggested for further exploration.
