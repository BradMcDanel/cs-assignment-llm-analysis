In this assignment, I learned how to effectively parse and analyze data from a CSV file and represent it in a meaningful way using Python. I improved my understanding of using dictionaries to store complex relationships and practiced creating functions that encapsulate specific tasks. Additionally, I gained experience in using command line arguments to manage input files, handling errors gracefully, and writing modular code that follows good coding practices.
