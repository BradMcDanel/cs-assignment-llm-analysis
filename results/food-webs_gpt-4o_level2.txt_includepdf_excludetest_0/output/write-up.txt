Description:
This program analyzes food webs from a CSV file containing predator-prey relationships. The program
reads the data, processes it, and outputs various characteristics of the food web such as apex predators,
producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and the height of each organism in the food web.
The program is divided into several functions, each handling a specific part of the assignment.

Functions:
- read_food_web_file: Reads and parses the food web data from a file.
- display_predators_and_prey: Displays each predator and its prey.
- identify_apex_predators: Finds and displays apex predators.
- identify_producers: Identifies and displays producers.
- identify_most_flexible_eaters: Finds organisms that eat the most types of prey.
- identify_tastiest_organism: Finds organisms that are eaten by the most predators.
- determine_heights: Calculates and displays the height of each organism in the food web.

The program uses the `formatList` function from the `formatList.py` script to generate nicely formatted
output for lists. The solution adheres to all requirements, including command line argument handling,
error checking, and file reading conventions.

For testing, I used the `sys.argv` override technique inside IDLE as recommended.
