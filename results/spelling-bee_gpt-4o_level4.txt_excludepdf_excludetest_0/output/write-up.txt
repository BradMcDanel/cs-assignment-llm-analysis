In this assignment, I learned how to handle string processing, list manipulation, and file I/O in Python. The project also emphasized the importance of breaking down a large problem into manageable milestones. By implementing callback functions, I was able to create an interactive puzzle solver that dynamically updates based on user input. Additionally, through the process of refactoring, I improved the structure and readability of my code. This project provided valuable experience in designing and implementing an engaging and functional application.
