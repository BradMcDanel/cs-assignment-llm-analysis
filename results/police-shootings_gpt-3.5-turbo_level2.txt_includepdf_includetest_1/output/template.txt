Question 1:
Working on this project has provided insights into the analysis of real-world data using Python dictionaries. It has highlighted the importance of understanding demographics and how to interpret data to draw meaningful conclusions. The process of investigating fatal police shootings data has raised awareness about racial disparities and the need for further examination in this area.
