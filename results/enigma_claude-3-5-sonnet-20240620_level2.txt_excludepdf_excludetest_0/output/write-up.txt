This implementation follows the Model-View-Controller pattern as described in the assignment. The EnigmaModel class acts as the model, while the provided EnigmaView class handles both the view and controller aspects.

Key features implemented:

1. Keyboard activation: The keys_down dictionary tracks which keys are pressed.

2. Lamp panel: The lamps_on dictionary tracks which lamps are lit.

3. Rotor data structure: The EnigmaRotor class encapsulates rotor behavior, including permutations, offsets, and advancement.

4. Encryption: The encrypt method implements the full encryption path through the rotors and reflector.

5. Rotor advancement: The advance_rotors method handles advancing rotors, including carrying to the next rotor when a full revolution is made.

The implementation follows the milestones outlined in the assignment:

1. Keyboard activation is implemented in key_pressed, key_released, and is_key_down methods.
2. Lamp panel is connected to keys in the key_pressed and key_released methods.
3. Rotor data structure is implemented in the EnigmaRotor class.
4. One stage encryption is part of the full encryption path.
5. Full encryption path is implemented in the encrypt method.
6. Rotor advancement on key press is handled in the key_pressed method.

The code uses helper functions like apply_permutation to handle the core encryption logic, making it easier to understand and maintain. The EnigmaRotor class encapsulates rotor-specific behavior, following object-oriented design principles.

This implementation should provide a working Enigma machine simulator as specified in the assignment.
