********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The database stores the following columns from the dataset: name, date, armed, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the database are the unique identifiers (IDs) from the dataset.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The type of the values in the database is a dictionary.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
An example value in the database is:
{'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}

********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.  
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population. 
While black people make up about 13.4% of the U.S. population, they represent a much larger fraction of the subjects in fatal police shootings.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject is also higher than the representation of black people in the general population. 
It is higher than the proportion of black subjects in all fatal police shootings, indicating a disparity in the frequency of unarmed black subjects being fatally shot by police.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to use Python to analyze real-world data and gain insights into sensitive societal issues. 
The data analysis revealed significant disparities in the representation of black people in fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population. 
This project also highlighted the importance of cleaning and organizing data before analysis. 
Additionally, creating dictionaries and using loops to aggregate data were valuable programming skills that I practiced. 
Overall, the project was eye-opening and demonstrated the power of data analysis in uncovering critical issues.
