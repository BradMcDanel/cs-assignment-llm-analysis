This implementation follows all the requirements specified in the assignment. Here are some key points about the solution:

1. File reading and error handling:
   - The program reads the filename from command line arguments or prompts the user if not provided.
   - It handles errors for file not found and incorrect number of command line arguments.

2. Data structure:
   - The food web is stored in a dictionary where keys are predators and values are lists of prey.

3. Modularity:
   - The code is divided into functions for each part of the assignment, promoting readability and maintainability.

4. Efficiency:
   - The file is read only once, and the data is processed in memory for all subsequent operations.

5. Style and best practices:
   - The code follows good Python style with appropriate naming conventions and comments.
   - It avoids global variables and uses function parameters and return values for data passing.
   - The main code is encapsulated in a main() function.

6. Algorithm for heights:
   - The get_heights() function implements the iterative algorithm provided in the assignment to calculate the height of each organism in the food web.

This solution should meet all the requirements and produce the expected output for the given food web file.
