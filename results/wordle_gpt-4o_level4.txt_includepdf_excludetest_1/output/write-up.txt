In this assignment, I implemented a Wordle game clone by following a series of milestones. The key steps included:

1. Displaying a randomly selected word in the first row of boxes.
2. Checking if the entered word by the user is in the dictionary and displaying a message if it isn't.
3. Coloring the boxes based on the entered word's correctness, including handling multiple instances of the same letter.
4. Updating the colors on the virtual keyboard to reflect the status of the guessed letters.

I learned the importance of breaking down a larger project into smaller milestones to ensure each part works correctly before moving on to the next. This approach helps in managing complexity and debugging effectively.

Future extensions could include creating a more balanced dictionary, enhancing the graphics for winning the game, and keeping score across multiple games.
