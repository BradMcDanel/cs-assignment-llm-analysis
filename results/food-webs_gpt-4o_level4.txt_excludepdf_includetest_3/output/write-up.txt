In this assignment, I learned how to process and analyze data from files using Python. Specifically, I worked with dictionaries to store relationships between predators and their prey. I also gained experience in designing functions to perform specific tasks and how to handle command line arguments for script execution. This assignment improved my problem-solving skills, especially in breaking down complex tasks into manageable functions.
