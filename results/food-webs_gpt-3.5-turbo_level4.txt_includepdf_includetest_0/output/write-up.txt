In this assignment, I successfully implemented the analysis of food webs by identifying predators, prey, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determining the height of each organism in the food web. The program reads data from a file, stores predator-prey relationships in a dictionary, and provides the required outputs as specified in the assignment guidelines. I followed good programming practices, divided the code into appropriate functions, and ensured error handling for file operations. Overall, the assignment was challenging but rewarding in terms of understanding food web relationships and applying Python programming concepts.
