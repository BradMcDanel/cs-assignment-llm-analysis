In this assignment, I learned about analyzing food webs, storing relationships in dictionaries, and identifying different types of organisms based on their predator-prey interactions. The assignment required loading data from files, processing the information, and outputting various analyses. I also learned about the importance of good programming practices, including using functions appropriately and handling errors gracefully.
