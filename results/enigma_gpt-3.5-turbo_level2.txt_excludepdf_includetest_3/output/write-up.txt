# I have implemented the EnigmaRotor class to maintain the state of the rotors, including the permutation and offset.
# In the EnigmaModel class, I have initialized the rotors using the ROTOR_PERMUTATIONS provided in EnigmaConstants.py.
# I have updated the key_pressed method to advance the rotors and carry to the next rotor when needed.
# The rotor_clicked method advances the specified rotor.
# The get_rotor_letter method determines the letter in the rotor window based on the current offset.
