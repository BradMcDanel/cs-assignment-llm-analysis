I have provided Python code snippets for implementing the Wordle game in stages as per the milestones outlined in the assignment. Each code snippet corresponds to a specific milestone and includes the necessary functions and logic to achieve the milestone objectives.

- The first code block (wordle_milestone_1.py) picks a random word from the dictionary and displays it in the first row of boxes.
- The second code block (wordle_milestone_2.py) checks whether the entered word is valid and displays appropriate messages.
- The third code block (wordle_milestone_3.py) colors the boxes based on the correctness of the guessed word and progresses to the next row.
- The fourth code block (wordle_milestone_4.py) colors the keys on the virtual keyboard based on the correctness of the letters in the guessed word.

Please incorporate these code snippets into the Wordle project to achieve the specified milestones effectively.
