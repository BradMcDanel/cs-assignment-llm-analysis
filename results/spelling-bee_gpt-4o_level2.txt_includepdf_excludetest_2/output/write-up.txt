# This project implements a Spelling Bee puzzle solver with interactive components.
# It utilizes the SpellingBeeGraphics class for GUI operations and handles user inputs
# to validate and solve puzzles. We implemented four milestones:
# 1. Validate and display puzzle letters.
# 2. Find and display legal words from a dictionary.
# 3. Calculate and display scores for found words.
# 4. Allow user interaction to find words and validate inputs.
# We refactored code to ensure reusability and clear separation of logic, such as word validation
# and score calculation, which are crucial for adding user interaction in the final milestone.
