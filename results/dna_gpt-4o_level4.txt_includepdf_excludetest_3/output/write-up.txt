In this assignment, I learned how to manipulate strings and work with CSV files in Python. The task involved reading data from files, processing it using loops and conditional logic, and finding patterns within a sequence. This practical application of DNA profiling provided insight into computational biology and demonstrated the real-world use of algorithms to solve problems. I also learned to use Python's built-in libraries like `csv` for handling structured data efficiently.
