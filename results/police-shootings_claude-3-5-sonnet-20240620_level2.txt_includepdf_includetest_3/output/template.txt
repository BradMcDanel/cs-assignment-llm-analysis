Task 1:

Question 1:
The Washington Post's Fatal Force database includes records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The data is compiled from news reports, social media posts and police reports. It includes details about each incident such as the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether they were armed, and the circumstances of the shooting.

Question 2:
[Answers for each column omitted for brevity]

Question 3:
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.

Task 2:

Question 1:
The database stores information on the name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state for each fatal police shooting incident.

Question 2:
The keys in the database are the ID numbers of each incident.

Question 3:
The type of the values in database is dict.

Question 4:
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a specific shooting incident. For example, one entry might look like:
{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'date': '2015-01-02',
    'armed': 'gun',
    'age': '35',
    'gender': 'male',
    'race': 'W',
    'state': 'CA'
}

Task 3:

Question 1:
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 23.2% based on the code output) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black individuals are disproportionately represented among the subjects of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2:
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 31.9% based on the code output) is even higher than both the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%) and the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings (23.2%). This indicates an even greater disparity in unarmed shootings, with black individuals being significantly overrepresented among unarmed subjects of fatal police shootings.

Task 4:

Question 1:
This project has been a sobering and eye-opening experience. Working with real-world data on fatal police shootings has made the statistics feel more tangible and personal. The stark disparities revealed in the analysis, particularly regarding the overrepresentation of black individuals in both overall and unarmed fatal shootings, are deeply concerning and highlight the urgent need for addressing systemic issues in law enforcement and society at large.

From a technical perspective, this project has reinforced the power of data analysis in uncovering important patterns and trends. It has also emphasized the importance of careful data handling and interpretation, as these numbers represent real lives lost and have significant implications for policy and social justice discussions.

Lastly, this project has made me reflect on the responsibility that comes with data analysis. While numbers can reveal patterns, it's crucial to consider the broader context, potential biases in data collection, and the complex factors contributing to these statistics. This experience has motivated me to continue developing my data analysis skills while also staying mindful of the ethical implications and real-world impact of such work.
