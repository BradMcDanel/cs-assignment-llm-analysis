In this assignment, I learned how to combine file I/O operations with algorithmic thinking to solve a real-world problem - DNA profiling. The assignment helped me understand the importance of breaking down a problem into smaller components, such as reading data from files, processing the data to find patterns, and matching the patterns against a database. Additionally, I improved my skills in string manipulation and the use of Python's csv module for reading CSV files.
