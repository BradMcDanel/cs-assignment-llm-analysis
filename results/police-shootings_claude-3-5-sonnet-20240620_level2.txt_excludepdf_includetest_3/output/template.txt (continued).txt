Task 2:

Question 1:
The database stores information from the following columns: id, name, date, manner_of_death, armed, age, gender, race, city, state, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, flee, and body_camera.

Question 2:
The 'id' column from the CSV file is used as the keys in the database dictionary.

Question 3:
The type of the values in the database is dict (dictionary).

Question 4:
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a specific fatal police shooting. For example, database['3'] might contain:
{'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'manner_of_death': 'shot', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'M', 'race': 'A', 'city': 'Shelton', 'state': 'WA', 'signs_of_mental_illness': 'True', 'threat_level': 'attack', 'flee': 'Not fleeing', 'body_camera': 'False'}

Task 3:

Question 1:
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings (calculated above) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests an overrepresentation of black individuals in fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2:
The proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed (calculated above) is even higher than the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This indicates an even greater overrepresentation of black individuals in unarmed fatal police shootings.

Task 4:

Reflection:
This project has been eye-opening in terms of working with real-world data and uncovering important societal issues. I learned how to manipulate and analyze data using Python dictionaries, which proved to be a powerful tool for organizing and querying complex information. The process of working with the data taught me the importance of data cleaning and understanding the context behind the numbers. 

The results of the analysis were sobering, revealing a significant disparity in the representation of black individuals in fatal police shootings, especially in cases where the subject was unarmed. This project highlighted the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues. It also made me reflect on the complexities of law enforcement and racial dynamics in the United States.

Overall, this project has not only improved my Python skills but also deepened my understanding of how data analysis can be used to shed light on critical societal problems. It has motivated me to continue exploring data science as a tool for social good and to always approach data with a critical and empathetic mindset.
