Implementation Explanation:

1. Dictionary Loading:
   - The dictionary is loaded from the DICTIONARY_FILE into a set for efficient lookup.

2. Puzzle Validation:
   - is_valid_puzzle() checks if the input contains 7 unique letters.

3. Word Validation:
   - is_valid_word() ensures words are at least 4 letters long, contain the center letter, and only use puzzle letters.

4. Scoring:
   - calculate_score() implements the scoring system, including the pangram bonus.

5. Puzzle Action:
   - Sets the beehive letters if the input is valid.

6. Solve Action:
   - Finds all valid words in the dictionary and displays them with scores.

7. Word Action:
   - Handles user word input, validates it, and updates the score and word list.

8. User Interface:
   - Utilizes SpellingBeeGraphics for display and interaction.

This implementation covers all four milestones:
- Initializing the beehive with valid puzzles
- Displaying legal words with scores
- Adding scores to the display
- Allowing user input to find words

The code is structured to be modular and easily extendable, with clear separation of concerns between different functionalities.
