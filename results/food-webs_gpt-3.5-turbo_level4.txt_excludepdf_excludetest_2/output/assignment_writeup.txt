In this assignment, I implemented a food web analyzer program that reads predator-prey relationships from a CSV file, stores them in a dictionary, and performs various analyses on the food web data. The program follows the guidelines provided in the assignment description and ensures correct formatting of output for each task. The program uses functions to handle different parts of the analysis, and it reads the filename from the command line argument. Additionally, basic error checking is implemented to handle file not found scenarios. Overall, the program fulfills the requirements specified in the assignment.
