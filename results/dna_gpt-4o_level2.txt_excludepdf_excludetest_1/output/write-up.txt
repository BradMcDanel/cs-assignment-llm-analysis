This program solves the problem of identifying the owner of a DNA sequence based on STR counts. It reads a CSV file containing names and STR counts and a text file with the DNA sequence. By calculating the longest consecutive repeats of STRs in the sequence, the program identifies to whom the DNA most likely belongs. The solution efficiently uses Python's CSV handling and string manipulation capabilities.
