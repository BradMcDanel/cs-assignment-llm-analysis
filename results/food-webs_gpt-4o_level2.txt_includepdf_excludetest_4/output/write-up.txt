# Write-up for the Food Web Analyzer
This Python program reads predator-prey relationships from a CSV file and analyzes the food web. The tasks include identifying:
- Predators and their prey with formatted output.
- Apex predators, which are not eaten by any other organisms.
- Producers, which do not eat any other species.
- The most flexible eaters, or those that eat the most different organisms.
- The tastiest organisms, or those eaten by the most different predators.
- The height of each organism in the food web, defined as the longest path to a producer.

The program reads the data file name from the command line, performs error checking, and outputs results according to the specified format.

The code is modular, with separate functions for each part of the analysis, ensuring clarity and reusability. The `formatList` function is used to format the output neatly.

To test the program, run it with different data files as input. Ensure that the data file is present in the working directory.
