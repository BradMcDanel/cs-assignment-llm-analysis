In this assignment, I implemented the Wordle game project by working with strings and graphics. I followed a series of milestones to gradually build the functionality of the game, such as displaying the word, checking user input, coloring the boxes, and coloring the keys. The project allowed me to practice working with strings, handling user input, and utilizing graphical elements to create an interactive game experience.
