In this assignment, I implemented a Python program that identifies the individual to whom a given DNA sequence most likely belongs based on the STR counts provided in a CSV file. The program reads the CSV file and DNA sequence, computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence, and matches it with the individuals in the CSV file to determine the most likely match.
