In this assignment, students will learn how to process DNA sequences and match them with individuals using Python. The program reads a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals and a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify. It then calculates the longest run of each STR in the DNA sequence and matches it with the individuals in the CSV file to determine the probable owner of the DNA sequence.
