This implementation of the Spelling Bee game covers all four milestones:

1. Initialize the beehive with the letters in the puzzle field:
   - The puzzle_action function checks if the input is valid (7 unique letters) and sets the beehive letters if so.

2. Display the legal words in the SpellingBee puzzle:
   - The solve_action function finds all valid words in the dictionary and displays them with their scores.

3. Add scores to the display:
   - Words are displayed with their scores in parentheses.
   - Pangrams are shown in blue.
   - The total word count and score are displayed at the bottom.

4. Let the user try to find the words:
   - A "Word" field is added for user input.
   - The word_action function checks if the entered word is valid and updates the display accordingly.
   - The user's score is tracked and updated with each valid word.

Key features:
- Modular design with separate functions for each major task (e.g., loading dictionary, checking word validity, calculating scores).
- Efficient use of data structures (set for dictionary and found words for quick lookups).
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- Proper integration with the provided SpellingBeeGraphics class.

Possible improvements:
- Implement puzzle generation as suggested in the extensions.
- Add a shuffle button to rearrange the outer hexagon letters.
- Optimize performance for very large dictionaries if needed.
