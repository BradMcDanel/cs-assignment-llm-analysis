********************************************************************************************************************************
Task 2, write your answers to the corresponding questions.
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The information stored in the database dictionary includes the name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state of each subject involved in a fatal police shooting.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The keys in the dictionary are the unique ID numbers from the fatal-police-shootings-data.csv file.

Question 3:
--------------------------------------------------------
The values in the database are dictionaries themselves. Each value dictionary contains information about a fatal police shooting, such as the name, date, armed status, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------------------
An example value in the database:
{'name': 'Tim Elliot', 'date': '2015-01-02', 'armed': 'gun', 'age': '53', 'gender': 'male', 'race': 'A', 'state': 'WA'}
This value stores the details of the shooting incident involving Tim Elliot, including the date, whether he was armed, his age, gender, race, and the state where the incident occurred.

Task 3, write your answers to the corresponding questions.
********************************************************************************************************************************

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in fatal police shootings is higher than the proportion of Black people in the United States population. The fraction of fatal police shootings with a Black subject is approximately 0.24 (24%), which is significantly higher than the 13.4% representation of Black people in the general population.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportion of Black subjects in unarmed fatal police shootings is also disproportionately high. The fraction of unarmed fatal police shootings with a Black subject is approximately 0.36 (36%), which is higher than both the 13.4% representation of Black people in the general population and the 24% proportion of Black subjects in all fatal police shootings.

Question 1:
--------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I learned how to use Python to analyze real-world data related to fatal police shootings. By working with dictionaries and iterating through data, I was able to extract meaningful insights about the racial disparities in these incidents. It was eye-opening to see the stark contrast between the representation of Black people in the general population and their proportion among subjects of fatal police shootings, particularly those who were unarmed. Additionally, this project highlighted the importance of understanding and interpreting data accurately to draw informed conclusions. Overall, this experience has improved my data analysis skills and deepened my understanding of a critical social issue.
