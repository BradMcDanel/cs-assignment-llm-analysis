This implementation follows the assignment requirements by:

1. Using a dictionary to store the food web data, with predators as keys and lists of prey as values.
2. Reading the file only once and storing all data in memory.
3. Implementing separate functions for each analysis task (apex predators, producers, etc.).
4. Using the provided formatList function for consistent output formatting.
5. Handling command-line arguments and file input errors appropriately.
6. Avoiding global variables and following good programming practices.

The height calculation uses an iterative approach as suggested in the assignment, avoiding recursion.

Potential improvements could include:
- Implementing the A+ part (identifying herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores).
- Adding more detailed error handling and input validation.
- Optimizing some of the functions for larger food webs if performance becomes an issue.
