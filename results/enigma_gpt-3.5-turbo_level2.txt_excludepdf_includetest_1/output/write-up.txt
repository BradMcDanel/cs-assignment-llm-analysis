I have implemented the EnigmaRotor class in EnigmaRotor.py, which includes methods for initializing the rotor with a permutation, getting the offset, getting the permutation, and advancing the rotor.

In EnigmaModel.py, I have initialized the rotors using the provided rotor permutations. I have also added placeholder methods for key_pressed and key_released to implement the encryption path. Additionally, I have implemented the invert_key function for inverting the rotor permutation.

These implementations are essential for simulating the Enigma machine and encrypting messages. Further work is needed to complete the encryption process and ensure the rotors advance correctly.
