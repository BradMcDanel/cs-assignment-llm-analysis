Task 1:

Question 1:
The Washington Post's Fatal Force database includes records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The data is compiled by The Washington Post journalists from law enforcement websites, news reports, social media, and independent databases. It includes details such as the race, age, and gender of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

Question 2:
[Detailed explanation of each column omitted for brevity]

Question 3:
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 data, 13.4% of the United States population identifies as Black or African American alone.
Source: U.S. Census Bureau (2021). QuickFacts: United States. https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221

Task 2:

Question 1:
The database stores information from the following columns: id, name, date, armed_with, age, gender, race, and state.

Question 2:
The keys in the database are the ID numbers from the 'id' column in the CSV file.

Question 3:
The type of the values in database is dict (dictionary).

Question 4:
Each value in the database is a dictionary containing information about a single fatal police shooting incident. For example:
{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'date': '2015-01-02',
    'armed': 'gun',
    'age': '35',
    'gender': 'male',
    'race': 'W',
    'state': 'CA'
}

Task 3:

Question 1:
The proportion of fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 23.3%) is significantly higher than the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%). This suggests that black individuals are disproportionately represented among victims of fatal police shootings compared to their representation in the general population.

Question 2:
The proportion of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (approximately 31.9%) is even higher than both the proportion of black people in the United States population (13.4%) and the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings (23.3%). This indicates an even greater disparity when considering only unarmed individuals, suggesting that unarmed black individuals are at a higher risk of being fatally shot by police compared to their representation in both the general population and among all fatal police shootings.

Task 4:

Question 1:
This project has been an eye-opening experience in working with real-world data to examine a critical social issue. I've learned how to use Python dictionaries to organize and analyze complex datasets efficiently. The process of calculating and comparing proportions has given me a deeper understanding of how data can reveal patterns of inequality. I was particularly struck by the disparity between the proportion of black individuals in the population and their representation among victims of fatal police shootings, especially unarmed victims. This project has reinforced the importance of data analysis in understanding and addressing social issues, while also highlighting the need for careful interpretation of results. It has motivated me to further explore data science techniques and their applications in studying and addressing societal challenges.
