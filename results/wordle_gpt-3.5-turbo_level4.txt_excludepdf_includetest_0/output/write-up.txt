In this assignment, I learned about the Wordle game implementation and the importance of breaking down a project into milestones for effective development. I successfully implemented the milestones for picking a random word, checking word validity, coloring the boxes, and coloring the keys based on correctness. I also explored possible extensions for further enhancing the Wordle game.
