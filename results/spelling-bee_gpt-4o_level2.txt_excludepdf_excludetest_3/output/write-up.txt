# Spelling Bee Project Write-Up

## Overview
The Spelling Bee project is a Python implementation of the popular New York Times puzzle, which requires the player to find words that can be formed using a set of seven letters, with each word containing the center letter at least once.

## Milestones

### Milestone #1: Initialize the Beehive
We implemented functionality to check the validity of the puzzle input by ensuring it contains exactly seven unique letters. Upon validation, these letters are displayed in a beehive pattern.

### Milestone #2: Display Legal Words
We extended the project to read from a dictionary and identify words that meet the puzzle's criteria. This involved filtering words based on length, letter inclusion, and the presence of the center letter.

### Milestone #3: Add Scores
We calculated scores for each word based on its length and whether it is a pangram. The total score for all valid words is displayed, with pangrams highlighted in blue.

### Milestone #4: User Interaction
We provided an interface for users to input words they find. Valid words are added to the display, and the score is updated in real-time. Feedback is given for invalid inputs.

## Challenges and Refactoring
Throughout the project, we frequently refactored the code to ensure maintainability and readability, particularly when integrating user interaction with automatic solving.

## Extensions
Potential extensions could include generating puzzles automatically or implementing a shuffle feature to rearrange the outer letters.
