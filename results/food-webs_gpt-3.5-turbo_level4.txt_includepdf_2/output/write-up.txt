In this assignment, we analyzed food webs by loading and processing predator-prey relationships from CSV files. The program was designed to list what each predator eats, identify apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, tastiest organisms, and determine the height of each organism in the food web. Each part of the assignment was implemented in separate functions to ensure modularity and readability.
