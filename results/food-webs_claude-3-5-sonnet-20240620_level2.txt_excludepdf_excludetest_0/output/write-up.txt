This implementation follows all the requirements specified in the assignment. It uses a dictionary to store the food web, with predators as keys and lists of prey as values. The program is divided into functions for each part of the analysis, making the code modular and easy to understand.

Key points:
1. Error handling for file opening and command line arguments is implemented.
2. The food web is read only once and stored in a dictionary for efficient access.
3. Each analysis task (finding apex predators, producers, etc.) is implemented in a separate function.
4. The height calculation uses an iterative approach as suggested in the assignment, avoiding recursion.
5. The code follows good programming practices, including appropriate comments, variable naming, and function organization.

The main function orchestrates the overall flow of the program, calling each analysis function and printing the results. This structure makes it easy to add or modify functionality in the future if needed.
