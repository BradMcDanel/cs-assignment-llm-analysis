In this assignment, we implemented a program in Python that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs by comparing STR counts from a CSV file with a given DNA sequence. The algorithm computes the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and matches it with individuals in the CSV file to determine the most likely match. The program provides a real-world application of algorithmic thinking and string manipulation in the context of DNA profiling.
