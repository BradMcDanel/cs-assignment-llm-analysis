The program `profile.py` reads a CSV file containing STR counts for individuals and a text file containing a DNA sequence. It then identifies to whom the DNA sequence belongs by computing the longest run of consecutive repeats of each STR in the DNA sequence and comparing them with the data in the CSV file. If there is an exact match, it outputs the name of the matching individual; otherwise, it prints "No match".
