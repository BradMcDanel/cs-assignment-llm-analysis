***Assignment to solve***

***Instructions***
- Your response should consist of python codeblocks.
- The first line of each codeblock should be a comment with the filename.
- If starter code is provided, you must re-write a complete version of each starter file in your response.
  - A computer program will extract each codeblock into its own file and then run the main entry point.
- If a completed utility/helper script is provided, you should use it as-is and not re-write it.
  - Indicate this with ```python\n ### utility.py - PROVIDED ###\n``` in a comment at the top of a codeblock.
    - This will trigger a copy of the provided script file
  - Failure to copy over scripts will cause the main entrypoint to fail (due to missing imports).
- Ensure each codeblocks start with the filename surronded by triple # characters.
  - e.g. `### main.py ###` or `### utility.py - PROVIDED ###`
- Some longer dictionaries and lists in the assignment description may be shortened in the codeblocks for brevity.
  - If these are copied via (PROVIDED), they will be complete.
- Make sure all filenames and class names are consistent with the assignment description.
  - Ensure the full filepath is used as shown in the initial comment on the first line `### ... ###`.
- If a write-up (often a .txt) is required as part of the submission, you should include that at the end of your response.
  - Sometimes, a template will be provided for you to fill in. Please ensure you fill in the template as part of your response.
- Before writing code, think step-by-step what you want to do and write the steps as comments.
  - Ensure that you start by indentifying which files you can copy over as `PROVIDED` and which you need to implement.
  - Create a complete list of all files ahead of time before writing any code.
- In the written instructions, pay careful attentino to the name of the files you should be generating.
  - Make sure your entry-point and all other files conform to the naming conventions provided in the instructions.
  - If it is not provided, use reasonable defaults (e.g., `main.py` for the entry-point).

***Example Response***
1. Copy over the provided `utils/rand_utils.py` file.
2. Based on the description, create a new file `mymath.py` and implement the `add` function.
3. Create a new file `main.py` and implement the `main` entrypoint.
4. Complete the provided `write-up.txt` file and answer all the questions to the best of my ability.

```python
### utils/rand_utils.py - PROVIDED ###
```

```python
### mymath.py ###
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

```python
### main.py ###
import mymath
import rand_utils

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    b = rand_utils.get_random_number()
    print(mymath.add(a, b))
```
